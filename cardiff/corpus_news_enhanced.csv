05-11-028_mirror,2011-10-15,SUPERBUG CURE HOPE,"TARGETING a toxin released by MRSA could help combat the lethal superbug, scientists say.

Virtually all strands of the bacterium release the poison SE1X, which causes the body's immune system to go into overdrive and damage healthy cells.

This can lead to high fever, toxic shock and potentially fatal lung infections.

Dr Ross Fitzgerald, of the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""If we can find ways to target this toxin, we can stop it from triggering an over-reaction of the body's immune system and prevent severe infections.""

Between April and June, there were 317 MRSA cases reported to the Health Protection Agency, down from 333 in the previous three months.

Researchers found 95% of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria - including MRSA - produce the poison.

The study, which suggests the toxin could be attacked with drugs, was published in journal Plos Pathogens.","{""Plos Pathogens"": 1}","{""Ross Fitzgerald"": 1}","{""the Roslin Institute"": 1, ""the University of Edinburgh"": 1, ""the Health Protection Agency"": 1, ""Plos Pathogens"": 1}","{""Ross Fitzgerald"": 1}","{""the Roslin Institute"": 1, ""the University of Edinburgh"": 1, ""the Health Protection Agency"": 1, ""Plos Pathogens"": 1}"
05-11-028_scotsman,2011-10-14,Secrets of the superbug toxin that makes body turn on itself,"Scottish scientists believe they may have found a new way of battling the killer hospital superbug MRSA.

The research suggests that targeting a toxin released by virtually all strains of MRSA - meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus - could help experts develop new drugs that can fight the infection.

Levels of MRSA in Scottish hospitals are now at historically low levels, but the infection, which is resistant to most antibiotics, can still prove fatal in some patients.

The latest research, by the University of Edinburgh, discovered a toxin known as ""SElX"", which leads the body's immune system to go into overdrive and damage healthy cells.

The toxin is made by 95 per cent of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, including MRSA strains linked with hospital-acquired infections.

When it is released, it triggers an over multiplication of immune cells, which can lead to high fever, toxic shock and potentially fatal lung infections.

Experts believe that the new study, published in the journal PLoS Pathogens, will help research to find drugs that could target SElX and prevent damage to healthy cells.

The Edinburgh researchers worked with US colleagues in Iowa and Mississippi to make the discovery.

The researchers looked at a strain of MRSA known as ""USA300"" which can cause severe infections in otherwise healthy individuals.

MRSA strains are known to produce different types of toxins, but scientists found that SElX is made by virtually all strains of the superbug.

This toxin belongs to a family of toxins known as ""superantigens"", which can invoke an extreme immune response.

Dr Ross Fitzgerald, from The Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""If we can find ways to target this toxin, we can stop it from triggering an over-reaction of the body's immune system and prevent severe infections.""

Figures from Health Protection Scotland show cases of MRSA reported in Scotland are now at their lowest levels since surveillance began in 2005.

The number of cases of the infection decreased from 69 to 52 - a drop of 25 per cent - between the first and second quarter of this year, according to the statistics.

Compared with the same period last year, cases were down from 79, with a reduction of over 75 per cent compared with the same period in 2007 when 215 cases were reported.

Health secretary Nicola Sturgeon welcomed the figures, but admits there is no room for complacency as the NHS also faces continued threats from bugs such as Clostridium difficile and the risk that other infections will develop resistance to antibiotics.

The Scottish Government has invested more than GBP50â€‰million funding over the past three years to tackle healthcare-associated infections, with measures including better enforcement of hand hygiene in hospitals and more inspections on wards.

The latest research in Edinburgh was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, the National Institutes of Health, USA, the US Department of Agriculture and Pfizer Animal Health.

Ireland has the highest rate of the disease in Europe.

The treatment is aimed at men with an advanced and aggressive form of the cancer which has spread to the bone.

It combines traditional c he m o -therapy with two doses of a different chemical.

And experts are hailing it as a massive step forward in the battle against the disease.

Project leader Dr Joe O'Sullivan said: ""While this combination treatment still has to go to phase two of trials, to know that this combination is safe and feasible as a treatment is a huge step forward.

""This is a significant development in the fight against prostate cancer.""

While it kills hundreds in Ireland every year the disease is 90% curable if it's caught early.

Chemotherapy is the most common treatment but the benefits are usually short-lived.

And now pioneering scientists are hoping that combining two different types of drugs may boost survival rates.

Dr O'Sullivan added: ""Traditional chemotherapy treatments aren't always effective in treating aggressive and advanced forms of prostate cancer so we in needed to develop a new treatment which will provide better outcomes for patients with this type of cancer.

""The combination of chemotherapy with the radioactive chemical Rhenium-186 HEDP has the potential to improve outcomes, including survival, for men with this form of cancer.""

02-11-002_dailymail,2011-02-08,"Danger of a junk food diet for children: Study reveals toddlers who eat more chips, crisps, biscuits and pizza have lower IQ","Toddlers fed a diet of junk food can suffer lasting damage to their brainpower, researchers warn.

Children who eat more chips, crisps, biscuits and pizza before the age of three have a lower IQ five years later, a study showed.

The difference could be as much as five IQ points compared with children given healthier diets with fruit, vegetables and home-cooked food.

But even if their diet improves, it could be too late as the ill-effects can persist for a lifetime.

This is the first study to suggest a direct link between the diet of young children and their brainpower in later life.

The project at Bristol University took account of factors such as social class, breastfeeding and maternal education and age.

Researchers also allowed for the influence of the home environment, for example a child’s access to toys and books.

They said good nutrition was crucial in the first three years of life when the brain grows at its fastest rate.

Young children eating a diet packed with fats, sugar and processed foods consume too few vitamins and nutrients, which means their brains never grow to optimal levels.

The findings are the latest to be published from a major investigation of childhood development called the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.

This tracks the long-term health and well-being of around 14,000 children born in the early 1990s. 

Parents completed questionnaires about the food and drink consumed by their children at the ages of three, four, seven and eight.

Three dietary patterns were identified; a processed diet high in fats and sugar, a traditional diet of meat and vegetables and a health-conscious diet high in salad, fruit and vegetables.



Researchers Dr Pauline Emmett and Dr Kate Northstone said the effect of a poor diet on brain development could persist forever, even if the diet improved.

In the study published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, children’s IQ was measured when they reached eight years old.

Dr Emmett said that the diet for children aged four or seven years had no impact on IQ scores.

But the 20 per cent of children with the worst diet at the age of three had on average an IQ score five points lower than the group eating the best diet by the time they got to eight, she said.

She added: ‘The brain grows at its fastest rate during the first three years and good nutrition during this period may encourage optimal brain growth. 

‘By the age of three, brain development is slowing down which is perhaps why the diet doesn’t have much effect afterwards.’

Dr Emmett said the ‘traditional’ diet of meat and vegetables and the health-conscious diet led to better IQ scores probably because they had more fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, fish and home-cooked foods.

‘This doesn’t mean you should never give your child a fizzy drink, chips or pizza, but these foods and drinks shouldn’t dominate the diet,’ she said.

‘Young children should be eating a normal family diet, with home-prepared fresh foods, but the problem is we have lost touch with food.

People are frightened of preparing it from scratch.’ 

Dr Emmett, who has dietician training, said she admired TV chef Jamie Oliver’s attempts to get families cooking and eating together, using simple recipes and good ingredients.

The study of 4,000 children used a points system to score their diets.

For every one point increase in scoring from a processed diet at the age of three, there was a 1.67 point fall in IQ points. 

For those children who ate the other diets, every one point increase in the dietary pattern linked to a 1.2 increase in IQ.

Michael Nelson, director of research at The School Food Trust, which aims to improve the quality of food in schools, said: ‘Given that around 23 per cent of children start school overweight or obese, it’s clear that healthy choices as part of their early development will stand children in good stead – not only for keeping a healthy weight as they grow up, but as this evidence suggests, improving their ability to do well at school.’

Graham Keen, Executive Director of the Health Food Manufacturer's Association, said: 'The best solution for most people is to eat as healthy a diet as possible, combined with other health-related lifestyle changes.

'For those looking to safeguard their nutritional intake, daily vitamin supplements provide essential nutritional insurance for millions of consumers.'","{""Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health"": 1}","{""Pauline Emmett"": 1, ""Kate Northstone"": 1, ""Emmett"": 3, ""Jamie Oliver"": 1, ""Michael Nelson"": 1, ""Graham Keen"": 1}","{""Bristol University"": 1, ""the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health"": 1, ""IQ"": 1, ""The School Food Trust"": 1, ""the Health Food Manufacturer's Association"": 1}","{""Pauline Emmett"": 1, ""Kate Northstone"": 1, ""Emmett"": 1}","{""Bristol University"": 1, ""the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health"": 1, ""IQ"": 1, ""The School Food Trust"": 1, ""the Health Food Manufacturer's Association"": 1}"
02-11-002_sun,2011-02-08,Junk food makes kids less brainy,"SCIENTISTS yesterday confirmed what healthy-eating campaigners have always known — junk food lowers a child’s IQ. 

Children under the age of four eating a diet of processed food, fat and sugar have lower brain power at 8½, a study of 4,000 kids revealed. 

Their IQ fell by 1.67 for every increase on a chart which reflected how much processed fat they ate. 

And the damage could not be reversed — as diet at the ages of four and seven had no affect on IQ scores. 

But feeding kids plain old-fashioned meat or fish and veg can BOOST their mental performance.

Those fed meals rich in nutrients and vitamins at the same age saw their IQ rise 1.20 points. 

The findings are particularly important as the brain grows fastest in a child’s first three years, experts said.

In a study spanning several years, scientists monitored the diet of kids at age three, four, seven and 8½. 

Dr Kate Northstone, who led the research at Bristol University, said: “In this population of contemporary British children, a poor diet, associated with increased intake of processed foods, fat and sugar in early childhood may be associated with lower IQ at the age of 8.5 years. 

“In addition, a healthy diet may be associated with higher IQ.

It is possible that good nutrition during this period may encourage optimal brain growth.”

But she added: “Further research is required to help determine the true effects of early diet on intelligence.” 

Barbara Gallani, of the Food and Drink Federation, said: “It would not be surprising if a healthy, balanced diet is important in IQ development — just like it is generally for children’s health and growth. 

“We believe it is important for everyone to eat a wide variety of foods. It’s possible to eat a healthy diet and still include some treat foods.” 

The survey findings will give ammunition to campaigners eager for a healthy eating crusade for nursery pupils — similar to TV chef Jamie Oliver’s school dinners campaign. 

But some experts believe the study may anger busy parents who rely on processed foods to placate children.",,"{""Kate Northstone"": 1, ""Barbara Gallani"": 1, ""Jamie Oliver"": 1}","{""Bristol University"": 1, ""the Food and Drink Federation"": 1}","{""Kate Northstone"": 1}","{""Bristol University"": 1, ""the Food and Drink Federation"": 1}"

02-11-002_express,2011-02-08,Proof junk food lowers a child's IQ,"EATING junk food can lower the intelligence levels of children, a study has found.

Toddlers eating diets high in fat, sugar and processed foods have smaller IQs at the age of eight than those eating vitamin-rich diets packed with fruit and vegetables.

The difference between the two diets could be as much as five IQ points.

Worryingly, researchers have also found the damage caused to brainpower by eating poorly when young can persist even if a child's diet improves as they get older.

It is the first time a link has been discovered between a toddler's diet and their intelligence in later life.

The findings, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, come after a study of thousands of children at Bristol University as part of a major investigation into childhood development.

Researcher Dr Pauline Emmett said 20 per cent of children with the worst diet at the age of three were on average five IQ points lower by the age of eight than the group who had the best diet.

""The brain grows at its fastest rate during the first three years and good nutrition during this period may encourage optimal brain growth,"" she said.

02-11-002_times,2011-02-08,"If you want a clever child, ditch the crisps and stock up on fruit and veg","Feeding children processed foods at a young age lowers their future IQ, while a diet rich in vitamins could make them more clever, research suggests.

A study of thousands of children in southwest England found that IQ scores decreased the more intensively a young child's diet was based on fats and sugars, while the scores increased for children who ate plenty of fruit and vegetables.

The 20 per cent of children who ate the most processed foods scored on average five points lower on tests than the 20 per cent who ate most healthily, researchers found.

Kate Northstone, of the University of Bristol, who led the research published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, said that a nutritious diet could produce a ""reasonable difference"" in IQ scores over time.

She said that while more research was needed to confirm the findings, it was important for parents to realise that healthy eating could have an impact on more than just a child's weight.

""Our message is to encourage parents to give fresh food as much as they can. It's impossible to say 'no crisps', but if we can encourage fresh food all the better,"" she said.

While previous studies have linked breastfeeding to higher childhood IQ, less is known about the effects of an early diet on intelligence later in life.

Dr Northstone and her colleagues looked at data from a study of children born in 1991 and 1992 whose parents were asked to fill in questionnaires when their children were 2, 4, 7 and 8½, detailing how often the children ate certain types of food.

The trial included some 14,000 children, with complete data available for 4,000 of them.

Each child was given a score on a scale ranging from a ""processed"" diet, high in fats and sugars, to a ""healthconscious"" one, rich in salad, fruit and vegetables, rice and pasta.

These were compared with the results of an IQ test taken when the children were 8½ years old.

Even after adjusting for factors including the mother's education and social class, the researchers found that a diet heavy in processed food at the age of 3 was associated with lower IQ five years later.

A healthy diet at 3 was associated with a higher IQ later on.

However, the researchers found that changes to children's eating habits after the age of 3 made no difference to their later IQ.

""A possible explanation for this is that the brain grows at its fastest rate during the first three years of life,"" the researchers said.

""Studies have shown that head growth during this time is associated with cognitive outcome, and it is possible that good nutrition during this early period may encourage optimal brain growth.""

The short-term effects of fatty, sugary foods have been a topic for concern, with Jamie Oliver's campaign to improve school dinners drawing impetus from research suggesting that poor eating habits among children was leading to behavioural problems and difficulty concentrating.

02-11-002_guardian,2011-02-08,Unhealthy diet linked to lower IQ in children,"Diets packed with fat, sugar and processed food have been linked to lower IQs in a study of thousands of British children.

While such diets at the age of three were found by researchers to be directly associated with a lower IQ at the age of eight and a half, foods packed with vitamins and nutrients had the opposite effect, helping to boost children's mental performance.

Toddlers' diets could affect IQ levels later in childhood even if their eating habits later improved, according to the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, which is tracking the long-term health of around 14,000 children.

""This suggests that any cognitive/behavioural effects relating to eating habits in early childhood may well persist into later childhood, despite any subsequent changes to dietary intake,"" wrote the authors, whose findings were published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.

Parents completed questionnaires on the type and frequency of the food and drink their children consumed when they were three, four, seven and eight-and-a-half years old.

Toddlers fed a diet packed high in fats, sugars, and processed foods had lower IQs than those fed pasta, salads and fruit, it was found. 

The effect is so great that researchers from the University of Bristol said those children with a ""healthier"" diet may get an IQ boost. 

Scientists stressed good diet was vital in a child's early life as the brain grows at its fastest rate during the first three years of life. 

This indicated head growth at this time is linked to intellectual ability and ""it is possible that good nutrition during this period may encourage optimal brain growth"". 

Scientists tracked the long term health and wellbeing of around 14,000 children born in 1991 and 1992 as part of the West Country's Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). 

Parents were quizzed about the types and frequency of the food and drink their children consumed when they were three, four, seven and eight and a half years old. 

They were marked on a sliding scale which ranged from minus two for the most healthy to 10 for the most unhealthy. 

IQ was measured using a validated test – the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children – of 4,000 children when they were eight and half years old. 

The results found after taking account of potentially influential factors, a predominantly processed food diet at the age of three was associated with a lower IQ at the age of eight and a half, irrespective of whether the diet improved after that age. 

Every 1 point increase in dietary pattern score was associated with a 1.67 fall in IQ. 

On the other hand, a healthy diet was associated with a higher IQ at the age of 8.5, with every one point increase in dietary pattern linked to a 1.2 increase in IQ.

Dietary patterns between the ages of four and seven had no impact on IQ. 

Although a modest increase, the scientists said the study's findings were in line with previous ALSPAC research that linked early childhood diet and later behaviour and school performance. 

Dr Kate Northstone said: ""This suggests that any cognitive and behavioural effects relating to eating habits in early childhood may well persist into later childhood, despite any subsequent changes – including improvements – to dietary intake. 

She noted the brain grows at its fastest rate during the first three years of life – indicating that head growth at this time is linked to intellectual ability.

A predominantly processed food diet at the age of three is directly associated with a lower IQ at the age of eight and a half, compared to children who eat a diet rich in fresh fruit and vegetables, according to a Bristol-based Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), which is tracking the long-term health and well-being of around 14,000 children.

The scientists who carried out the study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, emphasised however that they could not say for certain that processed foods are the cause of lower IQs as other factors such as social class and educational upbringing may be implicated.

Parents were asked to detail the types and frequency of the food and drink their children consumed when they were three, four, seven and eight and a half years old.

A diet rich in processed food at aged three was linked with an IQ that was 1.67 points lower on the IQ scale, where a score of 100 is average intelligence.

02-11-002_bbcnews,2011-02-08,Healthy diet 'boosts childhood IQ',"Eating chips, chocolate and cake may be damaging to a child's intelligence, according to researchers at Bristol University.

Their study suggests a link between a diet high in processed foods and a slightly lower IQ.

Writing in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, they suggest poor nutrition may affect brain development. 

The British Dietetic Association said more young parents needed to be educated about healthy eating.

The eating habits of 3,966 children taking part in the The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children were recorded at the ages of three, four, seven and eight and a half.

The researchers said three types of diet emerged: Processed diets which were high in fat, sugar and convenience foods, traditional diets of meat, potato and vegetables, and health conscious diets of salads, fruit and fish.

The children all took IQ tests when they were eight and half.

Brain development 

The researchers found a link between IQ and diet, even after taking into account other factors such as the mother's level of education, social class and duration of breast feeding.

A diet high in processed food at the age of three was linked to a slightly lower IQ at the age of eight and a half, suggesting early eating habits have a long term impact.

Dr Pauline Emmett, who carried out the study at Bristol University, said: ""Brain development is much faster in early life, it's when it does most of its growing.

It seems that what happens afterwards is less important.""

Although the relationship between diet and IQ was very strong, the impact was quite small.

Processed foods were linked with IQs only a few points lower. 

Experts in the field said the results had confirmed common sense.

Fiona Ford, spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, said: ""It's well worth looking at the long term impact of diets, everyone's familiar with the short term.

""The research confirms the type of advice we already know, but that's not always enough.

Sometimes a society has to help a person change, we need to be educating more young parents about healthy eating.""

02-11-002_metro,2011-02-07,Junk food diet ‘could damage your child’s IQ’,"Scientists at Bristol University say that parents who give their children junk food could be lowering their IQ, but equally, 'health conscious' diets could boost IQ. 



Giving children a diet high in fats, sugars and processed foods in the first three years of life has been linked to lower IQ, regardless of whether diet improved later on. 

Equally, giving children a ‘health conscious’ diet with lots of fruit, vegetables, rice and pasta could boost IQ, said scientists at Bristol University. 

The brain grows at its fastest rate in the first three years, indicating that head growth is linked to intellectual ability, said Dr Kate Northstone. 

‘It is possible that good nutrition during this period may encourage optimal brain growth,’ she added.

The findings emerged after the long-term health of about 14,000 children born in 1991 and 1992 was tracked as part of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. 

Parents were questioned about their children’s diet at ages three, four, seven and eight-and-a-half. 

The results were then divided into three classes: ‘processed’ high in fats and sugar; ‘traditional’ high in meat and vegetables; and ‘health conscious’ high in fruit and vegetables, rice and pasta. IQ was measured at eight-and-a-half years old. 

The dietary links to IQ still held after other potentially influential factors were taken into account. 

Diet between the ages of four and seven had no impact on IQ. 

The study ‘suggests that any cognitive and behavioural effects relating to eating habits in early childhood may well persist into later childhood, despite any subsequent changes – including improvements – to dietary intake,’ said Dr Northstone.",,"{""Kate Northstone"": 1, ""Northstone"": 1}","{""Bristol University"": 2, ""IQ"": 1}","{""Kate Northstone"": 1, ""Northstone"": 1}","{""Bristol University"": 2, ""IQ"": 2}"
14-11-014_dailymail,2011-05-26,"Drink-driving women are more likely to be 'older, better-educated and divorced' according to a new study","Young men in their 20s are four times more likely to be involved in drink-drive accidents than other age group and you might assume the same would apply for women.

But a new study has revealed that females who drink and drive are often older, better educated and divorced.

Academics at the University of Nottingham assessed global trends and are now calling for more effective treatment to target this demographic.



They discovered that existing rehabilitation programmes for female drink-drivers induce feelings of guilt and shame and increase risk of re-offending.

A paper due to be published in the Clinical Psychology Review details the study led by Professor Mary McMurran of the Institute of Mental Health.

 

Prof McMurran said: 'The profile of women drink-driving offenders is of being divorced, widowed or separated and having fewer previous convictions than their male counterparts.

'Thus, it may be that these women are distressed by their situation and are turning to drink for solace.



Over the limit: Women offenders are more likely to have parents and partners who abuse alcohol 

'Treatment programmes that induce negative emotions may actually increase emotional distress, which may increase drinking and, in turn, increase the likelihood of alcohol-related offending.'

The researchers reviewed 26 previous studies to help develop treatment for alcohol-related offending by women.

During the investigation they discovered that women drink-drivers were older, better educated, had a lower income and more likely to be separated, divorced or widowed.

They were also more likely to have parents and partners who abused alcohol and themselves had a greater history of mental health problems.

However it found that few women drink-drivers had previously been arrested for public drunkenness and other alcohol-related offences.

Prof McMurran added: 'Programmes designed specifically for women whose offences are alcohol-related need to be designed and evaluated,

'While these may draw on those programmes designed for men, greater attention to broader psychological health issues is needed as these may affect the success of the intervention.

'The information contained in this review may help inform the future development and design of treatment programmes for this neglected group of offenders.'

The number of women drivers caught drunk behind the wheel has increased rapidly since the mid-1990s.

In 1995, 6,793 female drivers were found guilty of drink-driving, compared with  10,765 in 2004.

Gender differences were also addressed but findings showed that alcohol tends to increase the likelihood of offending and the risk of violence in both sexes","{""Clinical Psychology Review"": 1}","{""Mary McMurran"": 1, ""McMurran"": 2}","{""the University of Nottingham"": 1, ""the Clinical Psychology Review"": 1, ""the Institute of Mental Health"": 1}","{""Mary McMurran"": 1, ""McMurran"": 2}","{""the University of Nottingham"": 1, ""the Clinical Psychology Review"": 1, ""the Institute of Mental Health"": 1}"

The findings may help to explain anecdotal incidents of widows and widowers who have died days or even hours after their spouse.

Former Prime Minister James Callaghan died of pneumonia aged 92 in 1995, just 10 days after Audrey, his wife of 67 years.

Musician Johnny Cash, who died of complications related to diabetes while in hospital in 2003 at the age of 71. It was said at the time that he had been left weakened by the grief of losing his 73-year-old wife June four months earlier.

Now immunologists at the University of Birmingham have found that increased stress levels and depression brought on by grief can interfere with the function of a type of white blood cell known as neutrophils, which are responsible for fighting bacterial infections like pneumonia.

The impact becomes more profound in older adults as, with age, they lose the ability to produce a hormone that can counteract this dampening affect, meaning even previously healthy elderly people can fall victim to disease following a bereavement.

Professor Janet Lord, who led the research, said: ""There are a lot of anecdotes about couples who were married for 40 years when one of them passes away and then the other dies a few days later. It seems there is a biological basis for this.

""Rather than dying of a broken heart, however, they are dying of a broken immune system. They usually get infections.""

The researchers studied the immune systems and hormone levels of 48 healthy adults aged 65 and over. Half of the group had suffered a major bereavement in the past 12 months.

They found that the antibacterial action of neutrophils from grieving participants were significantly reduced compared to those who had not suffered a bereavement. They also had raised levels of the stress hormone cortisol.

Cortisol is known to suppress the activity of neutrophils, making them less active. 

Most young healthy people produce a second hormone called DHEA, which Professor Lord and her colleagues found can counteract this affect, allowing their immune system to function normally. 

With age, however, adults lose the ability to produce this second hormone and so they become more vulnerable to disease at moments of stress.

The researchers have also found that suffering a hip fracture can also lead to this hormone imbalance that suppresses the immune system. 

It helps to explain why around 25% of people over the age of 80 who suffer a hip fracture subsequently die within one year.

Among patients who had previously been healthy, Professor Lord found that one in ten died within the year. 

Those suffering from depression or heightened levels of stress as a result of their injury had reduced immune responses and were most at risk of dying.

Professor Lord said: ""Our results in healthy adults who have suffered bereavement, the stress response and the effect on the immune system is as profound as we saw in those who had suffered a hip fracture.

""We think that what is going on is that even in previously healthy people are becoming very depressed and this has a powerful effect on the immune system.

""A 70 year old has around 10 to 20 per cent of the DHEA of a 30 year old, so it may be why older people are less able to cope with bereavement.""",,"{""James Callaghan"": 1, ""Audrey"": 1, ""Johnny"": 1, ""Janet Lord"": 1, ""Lord"": 3}","{""the University of Birmingham"": 1}","{""James Callaghan"": 1, ""Audrey"": 1, ""Janet Lord"": 1, ""Lord"": 4}","{""the University of Birmingham"": 1}"

They say that intense grief weakens the body’s immune system leaving it more vulnerable to infections.

Academics from the University of Birmingham have found that increased stress levels and depression brought on by bereavement interferes with a type of white blood cell called neutrophils.

These are key to fighting certain bacterial infections such as pneumonia.

The researchers say the effects worsen with age as adults lose the ability to produce another hormone that can counteract the damage.

They believe this could in part explain why couples who have been married for years die months, weeks or even days apart.

20-11-014_dailymail,2011-10-17,PROTEIN THAT HOLDS THE KEY TO FERTILITY,"Scientists have found a 'fertility switch' that could lead to new treatments for infertility and miscarriages.

Too much of the protein SGK1 in the lining of the womb makes it harder to get pregnant, they discovered.

Lead researcher Professor Jan Brosens, of Imperial College London, said: 'Our experiments on mice suggest that a temporary loss of SGK1 during the fertile window is essential for pregnancy, but human tissue samples show that they remain high in some women who have trouble getting pregnant.

In the future, we might treat the womb lining by flushing it with drugs that block SGK1 before women undergo IVF.'

But the treatment would have to have a short-lived effect, as low levels of the protein after conception seem to be linked to miscarriages.

Even if scientists cannot find a way to block the protein, they might be able to do a test to find out if a woman is more likely to have pregnancy problems so she could decide whether to try for a baby.

Other possibilities include creating a contraceptive that stops pregnancy by raising levels of SGK1, the journal Nature Medicine reports.","{""Nature Medicine"": 1}","{""Jan Brosens"": 1}","{""Imperial College London"": 1, ""Nature Medicine"": 1}","{""Jan Brosens"": 1}","{""Imperial College London"": 1, ""Nature Medicine"": 1}"

20-11-014_bbcnews,2011-10-17,Enzyme 'switch' clue to infertility and miscarriage,"Scientists have identified a ""fertility switch"" protein which appears to increase infertility if levels are too high and fuel miscarriage if too low.

An Imperial College London team took samples from the womb lining of more than 100 women.

Writing in Nature Medicine they said women with unexplained infertility had high levels of the enzyme SGK1, while those who miscarried had low levels.

One fertility expert said the research offered new avenues for research.

About one in six women have difficulty getting pregnant, and one in 100 women trying to conceive experience recurrent miscarriages, defined as the loss of three or more consecutive pregnancies.

The Imperial team also carried out mouse studies which found levels of SGK1 in the womb lining decline during the window of time during which they can fall pregnant.

When extra copies of the SGK1 gene were implanted into the womb lining, these mice were unable to get pregnant.

The researchers say this suggests a fall in SGK1 levels is essential for making the uterus receptive to embryos.

However, if low levels of SGK1 persist into pregnancy, this appears to cause different problems.

When the researchers blocked the SGK1 gene, mice had no problem getting pregnant but they had smaller litters and showed signs of bleeding, suggesting a lack of SGK1 made miscarriage more likely. 

'Focus for research' 

Prof Jan Brosens, who led the research at Imperial's Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, said: ""Our experiments on mice suggest that a temporary loss of SGK1 during the fertile window is essential for pregnancy, but human tissue samples show that they remain high in some women who have trouble getting pregnant.

""I can envisage that in the future, we might treat the womb lining by flushing it with drugs that block SGK1 before women undergo IVF.""

After an embryo is implanted, the lining of the uterus develops into a specialised structure called the decidua.

The team say lab tests show low levels of the enzyme may impair the ability of cells in the decidua to protect themselves against oxidative stress, a condition in which there is an excess of reactive chemicals inside cells.

Dr Madhuri Salker, who also worked on the study, said: ""We found that low levels of SGK1 make the womb lining vulnerable to cellular stress, which might explain why low SGK1 was more common in women who have had recurrent miscarriage.

""In the future, we might take biopsies of the womb lining to identify abnormalities that might give them a higher risk of pregnancy complications, so that we can start treating them before they get pregnant.""

Prof Richard Fleming, of the Glasgow Centre for Reproductive Medicine, said the research was ""encouraging"".

""To have something as clear as this, with a specific enzyme, is great.

It is giving us something to focus on.""

But, Prof Fleming, who is also a member of the British Fertility Society, warned it would be some time before the discovery translated into day-to-day practice.

""It's all very well to measure something that is missing - whether or not you can correct it is the next step.

""But at least we know somewhere that's directly involved, and can explore that.

A study in the journal Nature Medicine Sunday reports that researchers at Imperial College London found high levels of a protein called SGK1 are linked with infertility, while low levels of it make a woman more likely to have a miscarriage.

Enzymes are proteins that catalyze, or increase the rates of, chemical reactions.

Jan Brosens, who led the study at Imperial and is now at Warwick University, said its results suggested new fertility and miscarriage treatments could be designed around SGK1.

""Another potential application is that increasing SGK1 levels might be used as a new method of contraception.""

Infertility is a worldwide problem that experts estimate to affect between 9 and 15 percent of people of child-bearing age.

More than half of those affected will seek medical advice in the hope of eventually being able to become a parent.

Around one in 100 women trying to conceive have recurrent miscarriages, defined as the loss of three or more consecutive pregnancies.

In this study, Brosens' team looked at tissue samples from the womb lining, donated by 106 women who were being treated either for unexplained infertility or recurrent miscarriage.

Those with unexplained infertility had been trying to get pregnant for two years or more, and the most common reasons for infertility had been ruled out.

The researchers found that the womb lining in these women had high levels of the enzyme SGK1, while the women suffering recurrent miscarriage had low levels of SGK1.

In further experiments using mice, the team found that levels of SGK1 in the womb lining decline during the fertile window in mice.

When the researchers implanted extra copies of an SGK1 gene into the womb lining, the mice were unable to get pregnant.

This suggests a fall in SGK1 levels is essential for making the uterus receptive to embryos, they said.

01-11-016_dailymail,2011-08-24,"GO HOME FOR YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE TEST, PATIENTS TOLD","MILLIONS of high blood pressure patients will in future undergo testing for the condition at home.

For the first time in more than a century, readings taken in a GP's surgery will no longer be the recommended way to determine whether someone needs treatment.

New guidelines say patients should be monitored for 24 hours in their homes to overcome the problem of 'waiting room nerves'.

According to research, as many as one in four people with diagnosed high blood pressure, or hypertension, have readings that are artificially high because they are anxious when a doctor or nurse takes it.

This syndrome is known as 'white-coat hypertension'.

Guidelines published today by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence are expected to slash the number of patients needlessly taking drugs.

Patients whose blood pressure is high after being checked in the surgery will be asked to undergo ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM).

This involves wearing an inflated arm cuff and a box on a belt for a day to give a series of readings under normal conditions.

The machine will then be returned to the doctor, who will examine the readings.

Currently patients have a number of appointments to have their blood pressure checked.

In the UK, 12million people have high blood pressure, 5.7million of whom are undiagnosed.

It is estimated that the condition costs the NHS £1billion per year in drugs alone, and affects one in four adults.

Cathy Ross, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'The number with high blood pressure in the UK is staggering.

It's a major risk factor for heart disease and strokes so it's crucial we do all we can to get people diagnosed and properly treated as soon as possible.'

The new system would be particularly helpful in identifying those who have a misleadingly high score because of white-coat hypertension.

Professor Richard McManus, of Birmingham University, who carried out research leading to the guidelines, said ambulatory monitoring is already available in some GP surgeries and that widespread use would be better for patients and doctors.

'Treatment with blood pressure lowering medication is usually lifelong and so it is worth getting the decision right in the first place,' he said.

Professor Mark Caulfield, of the British Hypertension Society, said it was only patients 'right on the border line' who might need a change to their treatment.

This could be patients whose home monitoring has shown low blood pressure and who have taken low doses of medication, or those who did not display any signs related to high blood pressure such as heart disease.

Professor Bryan Williams, chairman of the guideline development group, said any patients who have been misdiagnosed will be identified during the standard review process, which is usually annual.

The cost of bringing in ABPM will be around £2.5million.

The guideline group says this will be recouped after two years because of a cut in the drugs bill.

After five years a saving of £10.5million per year is predicted.

The panel expects it will take around a year to extend the system across the country.

Under the new advice, it is also recommended that people over 80 are treated for high blood pressure.

In the past there has been debate over whether this will cause more harm than good because of the possible side effects of the drugs.

Advocates believe it will be more accurate as some people suffer from 'white coat hypertension' - the prospect of a test at the GP's surgery can raise blood pressure beyond normal levels.

01-11-016_times,2011-08-24,Anxious wait for doctor raises blood-pressure diagnosis rate;  Quarter of patients 'wrongly assessed',"Patients suspected of having high blood pressure are to wear a monitor for 24 hours because the condition is being wrongly diagnosed in millions of people who are simply nervous about visiting the doctor.

Fears that a quarter of those in whom the condition is diagnosed are being wrongly assessed have prompted the first change in the standard method of measuring blood pressure in more than a century.

GPs should no longer rely on readings in the surgery, but should send people home with a portable monitoring device, when high blood pressure is suspected, the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) will recommend today.

The 12 million people in Britain who have been told that they have the condition are likely to be reassessed in annual reviews.

One in four of these patients is simply experiencing the higher pulse rate that comes with waiting-room nerves, the watchdog estimates, meaning that millions are using blood-pressure drugs unnecessarily.

Although doctors say that the drugs will not be doing any harm, the NHS is wasting millions of pounds by prescribing them.

Nice estimates that savings on this bill will more than offset the cost to GPs' surgeries of having to buy the ambulatory monitoring devices, which cost about £1,000 each.

""This is clearly a very fundamental change. Practice in this area has not been changed in more than 100 years,"" said Bryan Williams, Professor of Medicine at the University of Leicester, who led the development of the new guidelines.

""It will ensure that those who really need treatment get treated.""

GPs are being told to switch to ambulatory monitoring over the next year.

Some have questioned whether the upheaval is justified, but Professor Williams said that the monitoring would give a far more accurate picture.

""People diagnosed with hypertension [high blood pressure] are potentially treated for the next 50 years of their lives and we want to get it right.

It's a big challenge for the health service but it's better for patients,"" he said.

At present, GPs initially measure blood pressure using an inflatable arm cuff in the surgery, calling back people whose readings are high for a series of extra measurements by the same method.

Under the new system, people with high readings in the surgery will be sent home with an ambulatory monitoring device to wear under their clothes.

The device automatically takes a reading about every half an hour and the average reading can be downloaded by a nurse after 24 hours.

Nice insists that such readings are significantly more accurate and a better predictor of the risk of heart attacks and strokes, which are two of Britain's biggest killers.

Anne Milton, the Health Minister, said: ""This is not only better for patients, but also a better use of NHS resources.""

Up to three million people could be told that they have received a wrong diagnosis, mainly younger people who have seen no sign of pressure-related damage to the heart and kidneys.

""These are probably people who are right on the borderline, not the people with very high blood pressure,"" Professor Mark Caulfield, President of the British Hypertension Society, said.

""We are not advising three million people to turn up tomorrow in the GP surgery.""

Cathy Ross, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""It doesn't mean current methods aren't working, only that they can be improved.

Anyone concerned about their blood pressure or treatment should speak to their GP or practice nurse.""

The guidelines also recommend that the over-80s be given drug treatment for high blood pressure.

Guidelines published today by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) recommend that patients should be monitored for 24 hours to determine whether they have high blood pressure rather than having a measurement taken in a doctor's surgery.

The 24-hour process, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), involves wearing a cuff and a box on a belt for a day.

The patient then brings it back the following day for the recording to be downloaded on to a computer and an automatic report generated.

Currently patients have a number of appointments to have their blood pressure checked, and it is estimated that 25% suffer from ""white-coat hypertension"" - a syndrome in which people show elevated blood pressure in a surgery or hospital but nowhere else.

Bryan Williams, professor of medicine at the University of Leicester, who chaired the Nice hypertension guideline committee, said any patients who had been misdiagnosed would be identified as the system was adopted across the NHS.

He said: ""Everybody on treatment is under periodic, usually annual, review and that is the opportunity to consider whether or not the original diagnosis was the right one.""

He added that 10% of the NHS could introduce ""this tomorrow . . . Our modelling showed that for every 100,000 people this new method would cost £2.5m in the first year.

But by year five you would see savings of £10m a year.""

The guideline panel expect that the new process will take about a year to introduce and that the cost of the machines, currently around £1,000 each, could halve.

The new advice also recommends that people over 80 are treated for high blood pressure.

In the past there has been debate over whether this will cause more harm than good.

But Williams said that patients would benefit.

In the UK 12 million people have high blood pressure and almost half are undiagnosed.

It is estimated that the condition costs the NHS £1bn a year in drugs alone.

Managing high blood pressure is the most important thing patients can do to lessen their risk of a stroke - the third most lethal condition after cancer and heart disease and leading cause of severe disability. 

It is estimated that 20% of hospital beds are occupied by stroke victims.

Cathy Ross, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""The number of people with high blood pressure in the UK is staggering.

It's a major risk factor for heart disease and strokes so it's crucial we do all we can to get people diagnosed and properly treated as soon as possible.""

Although there is no debate over the existence of white coat syndrome, some researchers argue that even mild exercise can influence readings and patients should be at home when an assessment is made.

A study in Finland five years ago concluded that the home approach ""is more convenient and better accepted by the patients for long-term use and also less costly compared to ambulatory monitoring.""

However, a study accompanying the Nice guidelines found that ambulatory monitoring was the most cost-effective way to diagnose hypertension among men and women of all ages.

For women aged 40, the saving was £323 for each patient.

The health minister Anne Milton said: ""Hypertension is a serious public health issue that affects up to a third of the population and needs to be better managed in primary care.

01-11-016_telegraph,2011-08-23,Home checks for high blood pressure; Patients suspected of having high blood pressure are to be given home monitoring devices over fears millions have been misdiagnosed because they were simply nervous in the doctor's surgery.,"About a quarter of people become anxious while they have their blood pressure taken in the surgery, meaning they potentially give a misleading reading.

This wrongly pushes many into the high blood pressure zone, a phenomenon known as white coat hypertension.

This means up to three million people could be taking drugs needlessly or in incorrect doses.

Now the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) has produced definitive guidelines so GPs can diagnose the condition more accurately. 

They recommend that when a patient is deemed hypertensive in the consulting room, they are sent home with a special machine called an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) device. 

This comprises an arm cuff and a small belt-clip monitor box containing a timer, compressor and computer chip, which can be worn during everyday activities. 

Patients wear them for 24 hours and readings are automatically taken every half an hour during waking hours.

The information is then downloaded on to the surgery computer. 

Studies show this method gives far more accurate readings than in the potentially stressful surgery setting, said Bryan Williams, professor of medicine at Leicester University, who chaired the guidelines panel. 

He said ABPM monitoring would help screen out those with white coat hypertension while providing more accurate readings for those who really had high blood pressure, resulting in better treatment. 

High blood pressure, which leads to heart disease and stroke, is one of the country's most widespread health problems.

Some 12 million people are officially diagnosed - although a quarter arguably wrongly - while up to six million more could have it without knowing. 

Nice has decided to recommend nationwide (England and Wales) use of the ABPM monitors - which currently cost about £1,000 apiece - after doing a financial analysis which showed they would save money in the long term. 

The NHS will have to fork out about £5 million a year to invest in the machines, but Nice predicts that after two years they will start to save money due to less prescriptions for ACE inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers and diuretics, which all lower blood pressure. 

These drugs currently cost the NHS £1 billion a year, or one per cent of its budget.

Cut out people with white coat hypertension and that bill would fall dramatically. 

Prof Williams described the new method as a ""step-change"" that was likely to be replicated worldwide. 

He said: ""It will ensure that those who really need treatment get treated and those who don't need treatment don't get treated unnecessarily.""

Nice estimates that in five years, treatment costs will be £15.6 million lower per annum than today, giving a net saving of £10.5 million in that year. 

These estimates are quite conservative because they are based on new diagnoses rather than re-evaluating the 12 million existing ones. 

However, Prof Williams believed many people with ""borderline"" hypertension would now question whether they really needed to be taking drugs and would ask to be re-checked. 

""The emphasis is on new diagnoses but, having scaled it up, we will be able to use it for reviewing existing diagnoses,"" he said. 

At the moment the availability of devices is very limited though, which could lead to long delays for patients. 

Currently, only about one diagnosis in 20 is made with an ABPM machine, said Prof Richard McManus, a Birmingham GP, who spearheaded the cost-effectiveness study, published today in The Lancet.

He said they were mainly confined to larger GP practices and specialist units. 

Questions remain over whether GPs will be convinced enough of the benefits to pay for the devices, which experts admitted were extremely expensive.

The Nice guidelines are not mandatory. 

Prof Williams believed the cost per device could come down to £500 in time, especially if the NHS ordered sufficient numbers. 

A much less expensive option is to use home blood pressure monitoring devices, which cost as little as £15.

These non-automated devices require patients to remember to take their pressure every half hour and record the information accurately. 

Nice says these can be used in the absence of ABPMs, but Prof Williams emphasised the evidence showed automated devices produced better diagnoses, better outcomes, and were eventually cost effective. 

Prof Mark Caulfield, president of the British Hypertension Society, believed the future lay in pared-down ABPM devices that plugged into smartphones, harnessing their processing power. 

iHealth, an American company, already makes such a device for iPhones and iPads - albeit without a timer for full automation - which sells for $100 (£60). 

*One in seven blood pressure machines used by GPs could be inaccurate, according to a study in the British Journal of General Practice.

A research team from Oxford, led by Dr Christine A'Court, tested machines in over 80 general practices and found 14 per cent did not meet British Hypertension Society standards.

Dr A'Court and her team concluded low cost aneroid machines were particularly inaccurate and should be replaced with digital devices.","{""Lancet"": 1, ""British Journal of General Practice"": 1}","{""Bryan Williams"": 1, ""Williams"": 3, ""Prof Williams"": 1, ""Richard McManus"": 1, ""Mark Caulfield"": 1, ""Christine A'Court"": 1, ""A'Court"": 1}","{""the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence"": 1, ""Nice"": 4, ""Leicester University"": 1, ""ABPM"": 3, ""NHS"": 2, ""Birmingham GP"": 1, ""The Lancet"": 1, ""GP"": 1, ""the British Hypertension Society"": 1, ""iHealth"": 1, ""the British Journal of General Practice"": 1, ""Oxford"": 1, ""British Hypertension Society"": 1}","{""Bryan Williams"": 1, ""Williams"": 5, ""Prof Williams"": 4, ""Richard McManus"": 1, ""Christine A'Court"": 1, ""A'Court"": 2}","{""the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence"": 1, ""Nice"": 2, ""GP"": 2, ""Leicester University"": 1, ""ABPM"": 3, ""Birmingham GP"": 1, ""The Lancet"": 1, ""the British Hypertension Society"": 1, ""British Hypertension Society"": 2, ""iHealth"": 1, ""Oxford"": 1}"
01-11-016_independent,2011-08-24,Blood pressure testers not fit for purpose,"UP TO one-quarter of the six million people being treated for high blood pressure in the UK may have been misdiagnosed.

The standard method of measuring blood pressure is inaccurate and should be replaced by 24-hour monitoring, using a device worn on the waist, experts advise.

The recommendation, by a panel of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Nice), is expected to be adopted around the world - the first change to the way blood pressure is measured for more than a century.

High blood pressure affects an estimated 12 million people in the UK, one in four of the adult population and one in two of those over 60.

But it remains undiagnosed in more than half of them.

It is one of the most important causes of heart disease, stroke and kidney disease and controlling it is one of the most effective ways of preventing premature death.

Traditionally, blood pressure is taken by a cuff attached to the patient's upper arm and pumped up to block the blood flow before being released slowly to measure the pressure at which blood starts to flow again.

Many patients suffer from ""white coat syndrome"" - their blood pressure rises because of anxiety triggered by a visit to the surgery.

A more accurate measure can be obtained by monitoring blood pressure for 24 hours using a device attached to the waist that pumps up the cuff worn around the arm every half hour and takes a reading, all of which are then averaged out.

Fewer than one in 10 patients are diagnosed in this way.

The devices cost more than £1,000 and drugs prescribed for blood pressure on the NHS cost £1bn a year.

Nice estimates that introducing the devices would save £10bn annually after five years.

Bryan Williams, Professor of medicine at the University of Leicester, who led the Nice panel, said: ""The important recommendations in this guideline will affect the treatment of millions of people in our country.

It is thought that potentially a quarter of patients could have been misdiagnosed using current methods.

New guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) recommends that patients should be monitored for 24 hours by wearing a special cuff to determine if they have high blood pressure.

Currently patients have a number of appointments to have their blood pressure checked, and it is estimated that 25 per cent suffer from ""white-coat hypertension"" - nervousness when seeing medical staff - which will cause a high reading.

A spokesman for Healthcare Improvement Scotland said: ""The new guideline relating to hypertension has no formal status in Scotland.

However, the information may be of interest to clinicians in mapping out care.""",,{},"{""EXPERTS"": 1, ""the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence"": 1, ""Nice"": 1, ""Healthcare Improvement Scotland"": 1}",,"{""the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence"": 1, ""Nice"": 1, ""Healthcare Improvement Scotland"": 1}"
01-11-016_bbcnews,2011-08-24,Blood pressure guidelines revised in England and Wales,"Patients thought to have high blood pressure should have the diagnosis confirmed at home, according to new guidelines.

Patients in England and Wales will be offered extra checks using a mobile device that records blood pressure over 24 hours, says the watchdog NICE.

A quarter of patients may find visiting a GP stressful, leading to misdiagnosis and being given drugs they do not need.

The move could save the NHS £10.5m a year, predictions suggest.

High blood pressure (blood pressure of 140/90mmHg or more) affects about a quarter of all adults in the UK.

It is a leading risk factor for heart disease or stroke and costs the NHS about £1bn a year in drugs alone.

Currently, most patients found to have high blood pressure for the first time are given a formal diagnosis if their blood pressure is raised at two subsequent visits to the doctor.

They may then be prescribed medication to lower their blood pressure.

Day and night 

Research suggests, however, that about a quarter of patients actually have ""white coat"" hypertension - where blood pressure is raised temporarily due to stress.

Now, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has advised doctors in England and Wales to move towards ""ambulatory"" monitoring of patients at home, using a device that automatically takes blood pressure readings every 30 minutes day and night.

Around one in 10 GPs are already offering ambulatory monitoring, either directly or by referring patients to a hospital specialist. 

The new guidelines were issued at the same time as the publication of a research study in The Lancet.

One of the authors of the paper, Professor Richard McManus of the University of Birmingham, said: ""This research shows that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring at the time of diagnosis of high blood pressure would allow better targeting of treatment and is cost-saving. 

""Ambulatory monitoring is already available in some general practices and we have shown that its widespread use would be better for both patients and the clinicians looking after them. 

""Treatment with blood pressure lowering medication is usually lifelong and so it is worth getting the decision to start right in the first place.""

It is expected to take about a year to implement the advice at a net cost of about £2.5m.

However, in the long-term the costs will be recouped, say experts, eventually saving about £10.5m a year.

'More accurate' 

Cathy Ross, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said the number of people with high blood pressure in the UK was ""staggering"".

""Some 12 million people are diagnosed with the condition and it is estimated another 5.7 million people have it but are unaware.

It's a major risk factor for heart disease and strokes so it's crucial we do all we can to get people diagnosed and properly treated as soon as possible.

""This new guidance will refine the way we test and treat people for hypertension, particularly by helping to identify people suffering from 'white coat hypertension'.

""It doesn't mean that current methods aren't working, only that they can be improved further.

Anyone currently concerned about their blood pressure or treatment should speak to their GP or practice nurse.""

Professor Bryan Williams from the University of Leicester, chairman of NICE's Guideline Development Group, told the BBC there would be an ""upfront cost"" of introducing the ambulatory equipment.

But he added: ""When you offset that against the reduced treatment costs of people who don't require treatment, and the reduced number of visits to doctors, we estimate that the NHS within about four or five years will save £10m.

""So it's a win-win situation for patients because it's a better way of making a diagnosis and the NHS actually saves money.""

British Hypertension Society president Professor Mark Caulfield said the move was supported by research.

He said: ""We've recommended that if high readings are found in the practice, that a 24-hour blood pressure monitor is worn because we found that the evidence now makes it very clear to us that this is a much more precise way of diagnosing high blood pressure.""

In response to the new guidelines, Health Minister Anne Milton said: ""These guidelines show that the use of innovations such as ambulatory monitors can provide more accurate blood pressure readings for patients as they go about their daily lives.

01-11-016_reuters,2011-08-24,Hypertension study prompts new diagnosis guidance,"Taking repeated blood pressure readings over a 24-hour period rather than a one-off measurement in the clinic is the most cost-effective way of deciding who should be prescribed drugs for hypertension, according to a study published Wednesday.

The findings in favor of so-called ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were immediately adopted by Britain's health costs watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), in new guidelines on how to diagnose and when to treat high blood pressure.

Bryan Williams, a professor of medicine at the Leicester University and chair of the NICE guideline development group, said the change would affect the treatment of millions of people in Britain and was ""a step-change that is likely to be replicated across the world.""

An estimated 1 billion people around the world have high blood pressure, or hypertension, which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death globally.

If it is left untreated, high blood pressure can cause strokes, heart attacks, heart failure and organ damage, including kidney failure and vision problems.

Those diagnosed with hypertension are often prescribed one of many blood-pressure lowering drugs such as Novartis's Lotensin or generic benazepril, candesartan, sold as Atacand by AstraZeneca and Takeda, or Novartis' Diovan, known generically as valsartan.

Patients are often prescribed the drugs for many years if not the rest of their lives.

""Ambulatory monitoring allows better targeting of blood pressure treatment to those who will receive most benefit,"" said Richard McManus of Britain's Birmingham University, who led a study published in The Lancet medical journal which prompted the NICE guideline change.

""It is cost saving in the long term as well as more effective, and so will be good for patients and doctors alike.""

Diagnosis of hypertension has traditionally been based on blood-pressure measurements in the clinic, but studies have found that home and ambulatory measurements are better indicators of who will suffer heart problems and strokes.

Ambulatory blood pressure measurement involves the patient wearing a blood pressure cuff attached to an automatic blood pressure machine for 24 hours.

Measurements are taken typically half hourly during the day and hourly during the night.

Experts say one-off blood pressure readings taken during a visit to the doctors can often be artificially raised due to what is known as the ""white coat effect"" when patients are nervous about going into a clinical setting.

In the Lancet study McManus' team analyzed the cost-effectiveness of the three approaches and found that ambulatory monitoring was the most cost effective way to diagnose high blood pressure in men and women of all ages.

It saved money in all groups and resulted in significant improvements in quality of life for both sexes in the 50-plus age group.

McManus said the new NICE guidelines marked a significant change in hypertension care.

Scientists uncover a link between impulsiveness and levels of the neurotransmitter GABA in the brain","Some men may be more likely to riot because of their 'impulsive' brains.

Certain individuals have lower levels of a brain chemical that helps keep behaviour under control, scientists believe.

Researchers from the University of Cardiff uncovered a link between impulsiveness and levels of the neurotransmitter GABA in a key brain region.

Those with low levels tended to be more aggressive and to respond rashly to 'urges'.

GABA is one of a family of brain chemicals that allow signals to flow between neurons.

Around 30 male university students had their levels of GABA measured using a specialised type of brain scan.

They were also asked to complete questionnaires that assessed different aspects of impulsiveness, a trait known to influence self-control.

Participants with more GABA in the pre-frontal brain region had lower scores for 'urgency' - the tendency to behave rashly in response to distress or strong emotions and urges.

Men with lower GABA levels had higher urgency ratings, making them more likely to act aggressively, drink and take drugs.

The link with GABA was specific to the dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex, a region critical to higher thinking functions.

The research, funded by the Wellcome Trust, is published in the journal Biological Society.

Lead scientist Dr Frederic Boy said: 'What is clear is that the way people behave results from a complex interaction between a number of genetic, social and environmental factors.

'What we've found is that one of the reasons why some men act impulsively may be related to lower concentration of GABA in a specific part of men's brains.'

None of the undergraduates taking part in the study had any history of psychiatric disorders or substance dependence.

The research helps to illustrate the role of basic brain physiology in controlling behaviour, said the scientists.

'The ability to regulate our behaviour in response to a constantly changing physical and social world is key to adapted life,' said Dr Boy.

'Failure in this finely-tuned mechanism is particularly important in most psychiatric disorders, where impulsiveness is the second most common symptom.

'We hope this research will lead to further studies and help bridge the gap between recent genetic studies and imaging studies of psychiatric disorders.'

It would deter fellas from acting aggressively and impulsively - including acts such as cheating and gambling.

The hope comes after scientists at two top British universities discovered the mechanism behind a chemical that can prevent men from behaving badly.

Treatment - as a nasal spray or tablet - would regulate levels of it to ensure they stayed moderate to high.

The revelation follows a decade of research on the neurotransmitter gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA).

For the latest study, researchers at Cardiff University's Brain Imaging Research Imaging Centre and University College London performed brain imaging scans on males under 30 to monitor GABA levels.

The subjects then completed questionnaires on different aspects of impulsiveness and self-control.

Those with lower GABA levels in the prefrontal cortex were more likely to act rashly.

The findings contradicts theories that self-control is all that is needed to beat impulsive thoughts.

04-11-008_bbcnews,2011-08-10,Cardiff University on brain chemistry and aggression,"Aggressive and impulsive behaviour in men could be linked to a deficiency of a particular type of neurotransmitter in the brain, a new study by Cardiff University scientists claims.

Neurological scientists have long suspected that impulsive and irrational behaviour may be caused, in part, by a lack of GABA (a chemical which sends messages between brain cells), in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

This is the part of the brain responsible for analytical thinking and decision-making.

However, the university's Brain Research Imaging Centre, (Cubric), has used the latest in MRI brain scanning to capture images of this process at work. 

The scientists studied male undergraduate students, with no history of psychiatric disorders or substance dependence, measuring their brain activity whilst asking them to make a series of hypothetical decisions. 

They found that those with reduced activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were more likely to make poorly-reasoned or snap decisions, consistent with aggressive and impulsive behaviour. 

""Now we're aware of this link, there are several directions in which we can take the research,"" said Dr Boy, who headed the research. 

""The next stage needs to be understanding why GABA affects the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in this way.""

""After that we can start evaluating whether there's any way in which we could treat a GABA deficit in this area.

I suspect this could be difficult, as GABA is present throughout the brain, and raising the level indiscriminately may have all sorts of unforeseen consequences.""

""The other area which needs further research is whether GABA levels in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex fluctuate over time, as this study is simply a snapshot of levels on one given day.""

Impulsive and irrational behaviour is the second most prevalent aspect in diagnosing any psychiatric illness.

It is a contributing factor in not only aggression, but also alcoholism, drug-addiction and problem gambling.

However the team specifically sought out subjects with no history of any of these conditions, in order to rule out the possibility that substance-abuse could reduce levels of GABA, rather than vice versa.

'Drunken fight' 

Dr Boy is sharing his findings with NHS Wales, to discover whether they can be used to predict and prevent potential instances of violence against medical staff. 

However he emphasises that whilst GABA deficiency appears to be a contributory factor in these behaviours, it is a much more complicated issue, and that environmental causes could play as big a part.

""I hope that our research will further scientists' understanding of how brain chemistry affects behaviour, but it's important not to over-emphasise the link.""

""For instance 80% of violent crime is committed under the influence of alcohol. 

""Whilst there is some evidence to suggest that reduced GABA levels may predispose someone to alcoholism, not everyone who gets in a drunken fight is an alcoholic.""

""What we've discovered is a possible reason why some people may find it harder to control their impulses than others.

However what sets humans apart from animals is the ability to regulate our behaviour in response to a constantly changing physical and social world.""

He added that the same findings may well be true of the female brain. 

Whilst scientists believe that women's brains are neurologically very similar to men's, female subjects weren't used for this study, as some steroids naturally secreted during the menstrual cycle mimic the action of GABA, and could therefore have invalidated the results.",,"{""Boy"": 2}","{""Cardiff University"": 1, ""Brain Research Imaging Centre"": 1, ""GABA"": 2, ""NHS Wales"": 1}","{""Boy"": 2}","{""Cardiff University"": 1, ""Brain Research Imaging Centre"": 1, ""NHS Wales"": 1}"

The Office for National Statistics revealed no significant change in the incidence of brain cancers during the nine-year period.

Revealing the findings in the journal Bioelectromagnetics, lead researcher Dr Frank de Vocht, an expert in occupational and environmental health, said it was 'unlikely we are at the forefront of a cancer epidemic' related to mobile phone use.

While the team cannot exclude the possibility that some people are more susceptible, Dr de Vocht concluded: 'A causal link between mobile phone use and cancer is unlikely because there is no evidence of any significant increase in the disease since their introduction and rapid proliferation.'

There is no 'plausible biological mechanism' for radio waves to directly damage genes, resulting in cells becoming cancerous, he said.

The team, which included experts at the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh and Drexel University, Philadelphia, did find a very small rise in the number of cancers in the temporal lobe Ð of 31 extra cases per year in a population of 52million. 

Cases of other brain cancers in men actually fell slightly.

12-11-008_express,2011-02-18,Mobile phones given a clean bill of health,"MOBILE phones do not cause brain tumours and will not trigger a cancer epidemic, according to a new study into their longterm use.

The research will provide relief to the 48 million Britons who regularly use mobile phones despite fears over their safety.

The nine-year study provides strong new evidence that the cancer fears were misplaced.

It concludes that there has been no significant increase in the rate of brain cancer in England since 1998.

Britain has the highest number of mobile phone users per head of population in the world.

Take-up in the UK is 89 per cent, with England at 90, Scotland 85, and Wales 89 per cent. In 1996 only around 17 per cent of households owned a mobile phone.

In the latest study, scientists from Manchester University reviewed brain cancer rates across England and compared them with mobile phone use.

Although there has been a slight increase in one type of brain cancer, there has been a decrease in another form.

The slight increase in cancer of the brain's temporal lobe was so small that it cannot be put down to mobile phone use, the scientists say.

And they believe there is no need for people to be told to cut down on their use.

The study, published in the journal of Bioelectromagnetics, concludes: ""The increased use of mobile phones between 1985 and 2003 has not led to a noticeable change in the incidence of brain cancer in England between 1998 and 2007.""

Fears over the safety of mobile phones began more than a decade ago as their popularity soared.

Back then, there was very little data on whether they might cause ill health.

Some animal studies suggested they might alter brain behaviour and even heat the skull, while others said they were safe.

But many people remained concerned about holding a device that conducts radio waves so near to the head.

For this reason, health officials urged people to be cautious and to limit their use.

Some people even started to use hands-free sets.

But in the past two years, most studies have given phones a clean bill of health.

Dr Frank de Vocht, who led the research published yesterday, said: ""It is very unlikely that we are at the forefront of a brain cancer epidemic related to mobile phones, as some have suggested.

""We cannot exclude the possibility that there are people who are susceptible to radio frequency exposure or that some rare brain cancers are associated with it, but we interpret our data as not indicating a pressing need to implement public health measures to reduce radio frequency exposure from mobile phones.""

Professor Malcolm Sperrin, director of medical physics at Royal Berkshire Hospital, said the study was good news.

""It adds to the bulk of evidence to suggest there is no substantial link between mobile phones and brain cancer.""

John Cooke, of the Mobile Operators Association, said: ""Its findings on cancer rates are consistent with similar studies in the Nordic countries and the US.

""It adds further weight to the view of the World Health Organisation, which stated in June 2010, 'To date, no adverse health effects have been established for mobile phone use'.""","{""of Bioelectromagnetics"": 1}","{""Frank de Vocht"": 1, ""Malcolm Sperrin"": 1, ""John Cooke"": 1}","{""Manchester University"": 1, ""Royal Berkshire Hospital"": 1, ""the Mobile Operators Association"": 1, ""the World Health Organisation"": 1}","{""Frank de Vocht"": 1}","{""Manchester University"": 1, ""Royal Berkshire Hospital"": 1, ""the Mobile Operators Association"": 1}"
07-11-025_sundaysun,2011-08-14,New treatment may stop asthma attacks,"A NEW treatment could prevent delayed asthma attacks, which can occur several hours after exposure to allergens, a study showed yesterday. 

Research led by scientists from Imperial College London could explain why around half of people with asthma experience a ""late phase"" of symptoms.

Scientists found that blocking sensory nerve functions stopped a ""late asthmatic response"" in mice and rats. 

The findings, published in the journal Thorax, could lead to better treatments for the disease, researchers said. 

An estimated 300m people suffer from asthma. 

Symptoms are commonly triggered by allergens in the environment, such as pollen and dust mites, and these stimuli can cause the airways to tighten within minutes, causing breathing difficulties. 

Many sufferers also experience a ""late asthmatic response"" three to eight hours after exposure to allergens, causing breathing difficulties of up to 24 hours. 

When sufferers have an ""early response"", the allergen is recognised by mast cells, which release chemical signals that cause airways to narrow. 

The mechanism behind the late phase has remained unclear but scientists found evidence ion rats that the late asthmatic response happens because the allergen triggers sensory nerves in the airways.","{""Thorax"": 1}",{},"{""Imperial College London"": 1}",,"{""Imperial College London"": 1}"
07-11-025_bbcnews,2011-08-13,'Late' asthma research unearths potential new treatment,"Scientists have stumbled on a potential new treatment for delayed asthma attacks which can occur several hours after exposure to allergens, a study shows.

A team from Imperial College London found that blocking sensory nerve functions stopped a ""late asthmatic response"" in mice and rats.

Around half of people with asthma experience delayed symptoms.

The charity Asthma UK says the research could help the understanding of asthma. 

Writing in the journal Thorax, researchers say the late asthmatic response happens because the allergen triggers sensory nerves in the airways.

These nerves then set off a chain reaction which causes the release of neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which causes the airways to narrow.

If these findings translate to humans, it will mean that drugs called anticholinergics - which block acetylcholine - could be used to treat asthma patients who suffer from delayed attacks.

These attacks can often happen at night, three to eight hours after the sufferer comes into contact with grass pollen or house-dust mites, for example.

A typical early asthmatic response occurs within an hour of exposure to allergens.

At present, steroids are the main treatments for asthma but they are not effective for all patients.

Connections 

Professor Maria Belvisi, lead researcher from the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London, said they realised the importance of sensory nerves in triggering symptoms by chance.

""We wanted to do the research on anaesthetised rats, but we couldn't because the late response had been blocked by anaesthetising them.

""We stumbled upon it. Now we want to work out how allergens trigger these nerves, because we don't know the exact connections.""

The data produced by the study suggests that anti-cholinergic therapy may be effective in patients that observe a late phase response to allergen. 

Separate recent clinical studies also showed that an anti-cholinergic improved symptoms and lung function in asthma patients.

Charity Asthma UK says 5.4 million people in the UK have asthma and it can affect people at any age.

Dr Samantha Walker, director of research and policy at the charity, said: ""This research seeks to understand the causes of chronic asthma symptoms and may pave the way for identifying new treatments for people with asthma in the future.""

20-11-019_telegraph,2011-12-09,"Child abuse rates 'have not declined'; Child maltreatment has not declined in spite of numerous policy initiatives to tackle the problem, research claims.","There has been a ""significant decrease"" in the number of violent infant deaths in England over the past decade, but ""sustained"" rises in neglect and abuse.

For older children, the number of deaths and injuries has not changed in recent years but neglect has risen sharply.

There has been no fall in the number of children or infants taken into care.

Academics at the UCL Institute of Child Health - linked to Great Ormond Street Hospital, which faced criticism for its doctors' failure to save Baby P - say the figures show that government initiatives to safeguard children have not succeeded.

Their study, published in The Lancet on Friday, showed ""no consistent decrease"" in maltreatment across six countries since modern child protection systems were developed in the 1970s.

Professor Ruth Gilbert, professor of clinical epidemiology at ICH, said: ""Our results suggest the need to focus on preventing factors that contribute to child maltreatment, in order to substantially reduce rates of child maltreatment in the future.

""For too long, policy has been driven by high profile deaths of individual children. We need to invest in population-based data to inform policy and to monitor trends. 

We also need to be able to link health and social care data to understand which professionals are seeing these children."" 

The death of Victoria Climbié led to the development of a computer database of all 11million children in England, which has now been abandoned, while the murder of the Soham schoolgirls led to plans for a quarter of all adults to be vetted before they could work or volunteer near children. 

This scheme has also been scaled back.

19-11-016_bbcnews,2011-12-11,Haemophilia gene therapy shows early success,"Just one injection could be enough to mean people with haemophilia B no longer need medication, according to an early study in the UK and the US.

Six patients were given a virus that infects the body with the blueprints needed to produce blood-clotting proteins.

Four of them could then stop taking their drugs. 

Doctors said the gene therapy was ""potentially life-changing"".

Other researchers have described it as a ""truly a landmark study.""

People with haemophilia B have an error in their genetic code, which means they cannot produce a protein called factor IX, which is critical for blood-clotting. 

Patients are currently treated with factor IX injections, sometimes multiple times per week, but the manufacturing process is expensive.

Researchers at University College London and St Jude Children's Research Hospital in the US were looking for a more permanent solution.

Virus modification 

They took a virus which infects people without symptoms - adeno-associated virus eight.

It was then modified to infect liver cells with the genetic material for factor IX.

The gene should then persist in the liver cells, telling the cells to manufacture the protein.

Six people were injected with the modified virus at the Royal Free Hospital in London.

Two were given a low dose, two a middle dose and two a high level. 

Results published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed levels of factor IX could be increased.

Normally, patients will have factor IX levels less than 1% of those found in people without haemophilia.

After injection, levels of factor IX ranged from 2% to 12%.

The first patient treated has maintained levels of 2% for more than 16 months.

One of the patients receiving the highest dose maintained levels which fluctuated between 8% and 12% for 20 weeks.

Carl Walker, aged 26 and from Berkshire, showed the greatest improvement.

He said: ""I have not needed any of my normal treatment, either preventative or on-demand as a result of an injury.

Previously, I used to infuse at home three times a week.

""I play football, run and take part in triathlons - and previously I might have had to infuse both before I took part and possibly after as well.

Not having to do that has been absolutely brilliant.""

Dr Amit Nathwani from University College London told the BBC that patients with 12% of normal factor IX production would no longer be seen in the clinic. 

""They would be able to go about their normal daily lives without any problems.

The only time that they would have a problem is if they were involved in a road traffic accident or had a big fall from a building site.

In the absence of severe major trauma these individuals would not know that they have haemophilia.""

He said the aim of the research was to take patients from a severe form of haemophilia to a mild one.

'Fantastic start' 

""All the patients have actually benefited from this gene transfer approach, even the patients who have not been able to stop protein concentrate infusion [normal therapy].""

He said these people needed fewer injections of factor IX.

Case Study: Sebastian Misztal

He said: ""It's been amazing.

I've had no side effects and I don't have to inject myself twice a week, which was not pleasant.

""My factor IX levels have increased and stayed constant.

When I cut myself shaving, for example, the bleeding just stops - which wasn't happening before.""

""This is the first study that has shown that you can actually achieve stable, long-term, therapeutic level of expression [factor IX production] in subjects with severe haemophilia B, so it's a fantastic start. 

""This is a great breakthrough, this is the first time that anybody has been able to show that.""

The trial was designed to test the safety of the procedure.

Trials in more patients will be needed to fully determine its effectiveness and patients will need to be followed for longer periods of time to see how long the effect lasts. 

There was an immune response against the infected liver cells around seven to nine weeks after the virus was injected.

In the trial it was controlled with steroids, but doctors will also want to see if they can avoid it happening.

Dr Katherine Ponder, from the Washington University School of Medicine, said this was ""truly a landmark study, since it is the first to achieve long-term expression of a blood protein at therapeutically relevant levels"".

She added: ""If further studies determine that this approach is safe, it may replace the cumbersome and expensive protein therapy currently used for patients.""

Chris James, chief executive of the Haemophilia Society, said: ""The society is delighted to see world-class research in the UK which may ultimately provide therapies to improve the life of those with haemophilia showing such positive results at this stage. 

""These are early days and all medical and scientific developments need to go through extensive testing for efficacy and side effects.

As such we would not wish to raise false hopes at this stage.

However, we hope that this research will eventually result in the removal of the need for regular injections and significantly reduce painful bleeds and debilitating joint damage for those living with haemophilia.""","{""the New England Journal of Medicine"": 1}","{""Carl Walker"": 1, ""Amit Nathwani"": 1, ""Sebastian Misztal"": 1, ""Katherine Ponder"": 1, ""Chris James"": 1}","{""University College London"": 2, ""St Jude Children's Research Hospital"": 1, ""the Royal Free Hospital"": 1, ""the New England Journal of Medicine"": 1, ""BBC"": 1, ""the Washington University School of Medicine"": 1, ""the Haemophilia Society"": 1}","{""Sebastian Misztal"": 1}","{""University College London"": 2, ""St Jude Children's Research Hospital"": 1, ""the Royal Free Hospital"": 1, ""BBC"": 1, ""the Washington University School of Medicine"": 1, ""the Haemophilia Society"": 1}"
19-11-006_guardian,2011-07-12,Birth defects linked for first time to smoking in pregnancy,"Clubfoot and missing limbs among malformations in newborns proven to be associated with expectant mothers who smoke

Doctors are urging mothers-to-be to give up cigarettes after new research linked smoking in pregnancy to babies suffering birth defects such as clubfoot, missing limbs and deformed limbs.

Those who smoke while expecting a baby increase the risk of their child being born with a serious malformation by as much as 50%, the study found.

 The disclosure led to calls for new measures to reduce what the authors called ""staggeringly high"" levels of smoking among pregnant women.

Although smoking by pregnant women has already been linked to a higher risk of a woman having a miscarriage or her baby being born prematurely or having a low birth weight, 45% of women under 20 do so while one in seven is still a smoker when she gives birth.

The authors from University College London said their paper was ""the first comprehensive review to identify the specific birth defects most associated with smoking.""

They reviewed 172 research papers published in the past 51 years covering 174,000 cases of birth defects. 

They concluded that for women who smoke while pregnant ""the risk was increased by 26% for having a baby with missing or deformed limbs, 28% for clubfoot, 27% for gastrointestinal defects, 33% for skull defects, 25% for eye defects and 28% for cleft lip/palate.""

The biggest increase in risk was for their baby having a birth defect called gastroschisis, in which part of its stomach or intestines protrude through the skin.

""People think that few women still smoke when pregnant. 

But the reality is that particularly in women under 20, the numbers are still staggeringly high"", said Professor Allan Hackshaw, the lead author, who is based at the UCL cancer institute.

 Public health education efforts usually do not mention birth defects as a possible result of maternal smoking, because until now it was not known which ones were linked.

""Now we have this evidence, advice should be more explicit about the kinds of serious defects such as deformed limbs, and facial and gastrointestinal malformations that babies of mothers who smoke during pregnancy could suffer from. 

The message from this research is that women should quit smoking before becoming pregnant, or very early on, to reduce the chance of having a baby with a serious and lifelong physical defect"", added Hackshaw.

Recent NHS data showed the proportion of pregnant women who were still smoking when they delivered their baby had fallen from 16.1% in 2006 to 14% in England last year, but was as high as 31.4% in Blackpool.

Janet Fyle, professional policy adviser at the Royal College of Midwives, said the study underlined that smoking both before conception and while pregnant damaged both the mother and foetus's health.

""Women thinking of becoming pregnant; pregnant women and women with young children should be told about the negative effects of smoking and the impact on their long-term health and that of others living in the home.

 Midwives should advise women who smoke to give up smoking and refer them to stop smoking services to help them quit,"" said Fyle. ""Partners should also consider this as a good time to consider giving up smoking.""

Professor Michael Patton, a consultant clinical geneticist at St George's hospital medical school in London and medical director of disabled children's charity Newlife Foundation, said: ""We have known for many years that smoking is harmful to the growth of the baby but this comprehensive review of the research on smoking in pregnancy also identifies the risk of causing certain birth defects and disabilities in the baby. 

This is an important health message as there are still many mothers, particularly young mothers, who continue to smoke in pregnancy.""

The Department of Health said women who smoked while pregnant should give up. ""Smoking in pregnancy is a major public health concern posing risk to both mother and their baby's health"", said a spokeswoman. 

The coalition's recent Tobacco Control Plan aimed to reduce rates of smoking throughout pregnancy to 11% or less by the end of 2015.",,"{""Allan Hackshaw"": 1, ""Hackshaw"": 1, ""Janet Fyle"": 1, ""Fyle"": 1, ""Michael Patton"": 1}","{""University College London"": 1, ""UCL"": 1, ""NHS"": 1, ""the Royal College of Midwives"": 1, ""St George's"": 1, ""Newlife Foundation"": 1, ""The Department of Health"": 1}","{""Allan Hackshaw"": 1, ""Hackshaw"": 1}","{""University College London"": 1, ""UCL"": 1, ""the Royal College of Midwives"": 1, ""St George's"": 1, ""Newlife Foundation"": 1, ""The Department of Health"": 1}"
19-11-006_bbcnews,2011-07-12,Smoking during pregnancy 'raises birth defect risk',"Women who smoke while pregnant should be aware that they are increasing the chance their baby will be born malformed, say experts. 

The risk for having a baby with missing or deformed limbs or a cleft lip is over 25% higher for smokers, data show.

Along with higher risks of miscarriage and low birth weight, it is another good reason to encourage women to quit, say University College London doctors.

In England and Wales 17% of women smoke during pregnancy.

And among under 20s the figure is 45%.

Although most will go on to have a healthy baby, smoking can cause considerable damage to the unborn child.

Missing limbs 

Researchers now estimate that each year in England and Wales several hundred babies are born with a physical defect directly caused by their mother's smoking.

Every year in England and Wales around 3,700 babies in total are born with such a condition.

The experts base their calculations on 172 research papers published over the last 50 years, which looked at maternal smoking and birth defects. 

The findings, from 174,000 cases of malformation and 11.7 million healthy births, revealed that smoking increased the risk of many abnormalities. 

The chance of a baby being born with missing or deformed limbs is 26% higher, and cleft lip or palate is 28% more likely. 

Similarly, the risk of clubfoot 28% greater, and gastrointestinal defects 27% more. 

Skull defects are 33% more likely, and eye defects 25% more common. 

The greatest increase in risk - of 50% - was for a condition called gastroschisis, where parts of the stomach or intestines protrude through the skin. 

Professor Allan Hackshaw, who led the research, suspects many women who smoke while pregnant do not know about these risks. 

""There's still this idea among some women that if you smoke the baby will be small and that will make it easier when it comes to the delivery. 

""But what is not appreciated is that smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of defects in the child that are life-long.""

 

He said very few public health educational policies mention birth defects when referring to smoking and those that do are not very specific - this is largely because of past uncertainty over which ones are directly linked.

""Now we have this evidence, advice should be more explicit about the kinds of serious defects such as deformed limbs, and facial and gastrointestinal malformations that babies of mothers who smoke during pregnancy could suffer from,"" he said. 

Of the 700,000 babies born each year in England and Wales, around 120,000 babies are born to mums who smoke.

Amanda Sandford of Action on Smoking and Health said: ""This study shows some of the worst outcomes of smoking during pregnancy. 

Pregnant smokers will be shocked to learn that their nicotine habit could cause eye or limb deformities in their baby. 

""There is clearly a need to raise awareness of these risks among girls and to ensure pregnant women are given all the support they need to help them quit smoking and to stay stopped after the birth."" 

Basky Thilaganathan of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said women who struggled to quit should at least cut down on how much they smoke. 

Professor Hackshaw said the risk was likely dose-related - meaning the more a woman smokes, the bigger the risk to her unborn child.",,"{""Allan Hackshaw"": 1, ""Amanda Sandford"": 1, ""Basky Thilaganathan"": 1, ""Hackshaw"": 1}","{""University College London"": 1, ""Action on Smoking and Health"": 1, ""the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists"": 1}","{""Allan Hackshaw"": 1, ""Hackshaw"": 2, ""Basky Thilaganathan"": 1}","{""University College London"": 1, ""Action on Smoking and Health"": 1, ""the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists"": 1}"
09-11-017_bbcnews,2011-12-23,"MRI scans 'are better for heart checks', experts say","Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans should be used to assess patients with suspected heart disease, rather than standard checks, experts say.

A University of Leeds study of 750 people found MRI was better at detecting the condition, and of ruling it out in unaffected patients.

MRI was also non-invasive and did not use radiation, unlike the usual tests.

A spokesman for the British Heart Foundation, which backed the study, said MRI should be used more widely.

CHD is caused when vital arteries serving the heart become narrowed or blocked by a build-up of fatty substances. 

This can lead to severe chest pain, known as angina, and if the condition worsens and remains untreated, patients may have a heart attack.

Expertise 

Patients with suspected angina are currently most likely to have either an angiogram - an invasive test where dye is injected directly into the heart's arteries - or a non-invasive imaging test called SPECT.

Angiograms and SPECT tests both involve ionising radiation.

MRI scans, which use strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce a detailed image of the inside of the body, are already widely used to help diagnose other conditions.

In the five-year, £1.3m study published by The Lancet, patients with suspected angina and at least one risk factor for heart disease underwent both kinds of imaging test.

The results were compared using an angiogram.

Dr John Greenwood, who led the study, said: ""We have shown convincingly that of the options available to doctors in diagnosing coronary heart disease, MRI is better than the more commonly-used SPECT imaging test. 

""As well as being more accurate, it has the advantage of not using any ionising radiation, sparing patients and health professionals from unnecessary exposure.""

Prof Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""For patients suffering with chest pains, there are a number of tests that can be used to decide whether their symptoms are due to coronary heart disease or not. 

""This research shows that a full MRI scan is better than the most commonly used alternative - a SPECT scan using a radioactive tracer.""

He added: ""MRI has the additional advantage that it doesn't involve radiation.

""At present, not all hospitals have the expertise to undertake such scans but these findings provide clear evidence that MRI should be more widely used in the future.""

15-11-027_telegraph,2011-10-28,Families and carers paymost of £34bn bill for dementia,"THE cost of Alzheimer's disease and dementia has risen to £34billion a year with families and carers paying most of the bill, a study has found.

Britain spends more on dementia than any of the 15 EU members before the 1990s expansion except for Germany, which has a much higher population, a report by Oxford University academics claims.

Health and social care, informal help provided by families and the expense of lost earnings due to illness and early death make dementia much more costly than heart disease and stroke combined, the report said.

An estimated 955,000 people in Britain suffer from dementia, but there is no known treatment that can protect against, halt or reverse its degenerative effect on the brain.

The cost of health and social care alone for each patient in Britain is £13,000 per year, significantly higher than the European average with only Sweden and Luxembourg spending more.

This figure leaves out the significant factor of informal care by families and friends, such as help with household tasks, shopping, transport and supervision, which accounts for £21billion each year - more than half of the total amount.

But it is our reliance on expensive care homes rather than informal arrangements that makes dementia care in Britain so expensive compared with the rest of Europe, experts said.

The annual bill for residential and nursing homes in Britain is estimated at £11billion and hospital inpatient care for dementia costs £1.2billion, which is comfortably more than any other country.

Dr Ramon Luengo-Fernandez, who led the study, said: ""In southern Europe daughters take care of mothers or fathers with dementia, whereas in Britain they tend to put them in residential care or nursing homes.

""People [in Britain] become more mobile and live a long way from their parents.

Rather than living in the town or city where they were born, workers tend to live further afield.""

A previous study by the same team of researchers in early 2010 estimated that the overall burden of dementia in Britain was much lower, at about £23billion per year.

The latest figures - which relate to 2007 - show the cost is 50 per cent higher, but academics put the increase down to the use of different criteria to produce their estimates.

The research, published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, showed that the total dementia burden across the 15 European countries was £166billion. Dr Luengo-Fernandez said that this was likely to be an underestimate because, for example, generic medicines not specifi-cally aimed at dementia but taken by many patients were not considered.

Rebecca Wood, the chief executive of Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""Worryingly, these figures are set to increase as the population ages and dementia becomes ever more widespread.

The only answer to dementia is research into treatments and preventions that can reduce its impact, improve individuals' quality of life, or cure the condition.""

Scientists have shown for the first time exactly how particular genes affect a protein called amyloid plaque which builds up in the brain and leads to the onset of Alzheimer's.

04-11-016_bbcnews,2011-11-11,Repeat offenders appear to have worse health in middle-age,"A life of crime appears to damage offenders' health once they reach their 40s, new research suggests.

Researchers from Cardiff and Texas universities looked at data on 400 men who have been followed since childhood.

They found offenders were more likely to be hospitalised and were 13 times more likely to be disabled.

The researchers had earlier found better health in their late teens and late 20s among those who had offended when they were young. 

The findings are published in the journal Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health.

The men are part of the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development, which recruited them when they were aged eight or nine in 1961 and living in inner city south London.

They were then studied in their late teens and late 20s. In both these earlier assessments, those who had criminal convictions were less likely than their peers to have physical illnesses or to have been hospitalised, and they were often fitter than their more law-abiding contemporaries.

But this study, in which the men were interviewed again after reaching the age of 48, found those who had continued to offend were four times as likely to have been hospitalised in the past five years than other groups, including non-offenders and those who had only offended in adolescence. 

Offenders were also found to have 13 times the risk of disability than the other groups.

And 13 of the 17 men who had died had a criminal conviction.

In the study group, 62% never offended, 24% had offended in their teens and just under 14% were chronic offenders.

Prof Jonathan Shepherd, director of the Violence and Society Research Group at Cardiff University, who led the research, said: ""At a younger age, offenders do seem to be healthier in many ways than non-offenders. 

""Once they reach their 40s it seems that the health consequences of their lifestyle catch up with them.

""The reasons for this poorer health are not clear. 

High-risk behaviour and lifestyle might increase the chances of accidents and injury, leading to hospitalisation and disability. 

""It could be that if they are in touch with probation officers, prison officers, they may have increased access to and knowledge of the benefits system. 

""Or it could be to do with being in custody for a long time.

""What is clear, however, is that those who continue to offend at a high rate as adults are at a higher risk of poor health than other groups, including those who offended as adolescents and then stopped.""

Prof Shepherd said this showed: ""The cost of repeat offending is not just limited to the effects of criminal activity.""

The researchers said the health, social and criminal justice agencies should work together to try to limit post-adolescent offending, reducing the risk of illness in later life and the cost to society.","{""Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health"": 1}","{""Jonathan"": 1, ""Shepherd"": 2}","{""Criminal Behaviour"": 1, ""Mental Health"": 1, ""the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development"": 1, ""the Violence and Society Research Group"": 1, ""Cardiff University"": 1}","{""Jonathan"": 1, ""Shepherd"": 2}","{""Criminal Behaviour"": 1, ""Mental Health"": 1, ""the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development"": 1, ""the Violence and Society Research Group"": 1, ""Cardiff University"": 1}"
01-11-013_dailymail,2011-08-05,SIMPLE SENSOR THAT COULD SAVE A BABY'S LIFE,"All babies should be routinely screened at birth for life-threatening heart defects using a simple and painless test, say researchers.

The pulse oximetry test measures blood oxygen levels in newborns with a small skin sensor placed on a hand or foot.

The test identifies some babies with congenital heart defects Ð one of the major causes of infant death in the western world Ð which would otherwise be missed by doctors.

In some cases, infants would only be diagnosed at a later stage when they have developed serious complications or died.

Identifying the problems early on allows doctors to correct or reduce them with surgery, where possible, or prescribe medication.

Heart defects affect one in 145 newborn babies in the UK, and current techniques for identifying babies with a congenital heart defect involve ultrasound scans and routine physical examinations shortly after birth.

These methods pick up around half of affected babies, while the pulse oximetry test can pick up three-quarters alone.

In a study, it was used on more than 20,000 babies born at six maternity units across the West Midlands who all appeared to be healthy at birth.

The tests, conducted between February 2008 and January 2009, detected 53 cases of major congenital heart disease, 24 of which were critical.

In 35 cases, congenital heart defects were already suspected after ultrasound examinations.

But 18 cases identified by pulse oximetry had not been picked up by ultrasound.

The test spotted three-quarters of all critical cases.

When it was combined with ultrasound and physical examination, the detection rate rose to 92 per cent and no babies died from undiagnosed problems.

It did not detect all cases of 'critical' congenital defects because some are not associated with low oxygen levels in the blood.

The findings were published in an online edition of The Lancet medical journal.

Lead researcher Dr Andrew Ewer, from the University of Birmingham, said the test was simple, painless and non-invasive, and usually performed within 24 hours of birth.

He said: 'A small probe is put on the baby's hand and then on the foot, the machine is switched on and you obtain a reading.

That's it.

It takes longer to undress the baby than it does to do the test.

'This study has shown conclusively that this test is advantageous.

We would like to see all babies being routinely tested.

In this way the test will pick up additional babies who might otherwise have become very ill or even died.

'I think we now have enough evidence to say that pulse oximetry screening should be incorporated into everyday clinical practice.'

The test also flagged up some non-heart related problems such as respiratory disorders and infections.

A British study involving more than 20,000 babies suggests that carrying out a pulse oximetry test, which measures oxygen levels in the blood, would identify newborns with congenital heart defects and save many lives.

Current screening for such problems involves ultrasound before delivery and routine examination in the first 24 hours after birth, but can often fail to pick up serious heart defects.

Midwives at six maternity units in the West Midlands used the PulseOx test, where a small probe is put on the baby's hand and then on the foot.

Babies with low oxygen levels in the blood soon after birth may be at increased risk of heart defects.

Those who failed the test were given a heart ultrasound.

Of 195 babies with an abnormal result in the test, 26 had a major congenital heart defect and a further 46 had other significant problems that required urgent treatment.

Heart defects present from birth are one of the leading causes of infant death in the developed world and affect one in 145 newborn babies in the UK.

The research, which is published in The Lancet, was carried out between February 2008 and January 2009.

Of the 26 babies with major heart defects picked up by the PulseOx test, 18 were critical cases and eight serious.

It did not pick up a further six critical cases.

Dr Andrew Ewer, who led the research team from the University of Birmingham and Birmingham Women's Hospital, described the study as compelling evidence for routine testing.

A number of babies' heart defects are spotted during a mid-pregnancy ultrasound scan and others may be picked up in routine physical examinationsafter birth.

But sometimes the problem is not spotted until the baby becomes ill at home.

Congenital heart defects are one of the main causes of of baby deaths in the developed world.

A study published in the Lancet says lives could be saved if all newborn babies were given a cheap and simple test to establish the oxygen levels in their blood.

Small studies of the pulse oximetry test - in which sensors are placed on a hand and foot - have proved inconclusive, so the National Institute for Health Research funded the study by Andrew Ewer and colleagues from Birmingham University and Birmingham Women's hospital to determine whether it would be useful for the NHS.

Their study in six maternity centres in the UK involved 20,000 babies between February 2008 and January 2009.

The test detected 75% of all critical cases (those that result in death or surgery within 28 days of birth) and 49% of major congenital heart defects (causing death without surgery within 12 months).

The authors calculate that 264 out of 100,000 newborn babies would have major congenital heart defects' 130 of which would be identified by the test.

Around 120 babies would be critical cases, 90 of whom would be identified by pulse oximetry.

Combining the test with ultrasound and the routine physical examination after birth, 92% of congenital heart defects were identified.

No babies in the study died from undiagnosed heart disease.

""Pulse oximetry is a safe, non-invasive, feasible and reasonably accurate test.

A study of 20,055 newborns, published in The Lancet, showed testing oxygen in the blood was more successful than other checks available.

The researchers have called for the oxygen test to be used in hospitals across the UK.

The British Heart Foundation said the test could ""make a real difference"" as cases go unnoticed. 

Congenital heart defects - such as holes between chambers in the heart and valve defects - affect around one in every 145 babies.

They are detected by ultrasound during pregnancy or by listening to the heart after birth, however, the success rate is low. 

Decades old 

Doctors at six maternity hospitals in the UK used pulse oximeters - a piece of technology which has been around for 20 years - to detect levels of oxygen in the blood.

If the levels were too low, or varied between the hands and feet, more detailed examinations took place.

The test takes less than five minutes and it found 75% of the most serious abnormalities.

In combination with traditional methods, 92% of cases were detected.

While some defects are inoperable, advances in surgery mean most can be corrected. 

Dr Andrew Ewer, the lead researcher at the University of Birmingham, called for the test to be adopted by hospitals across the UK.

""It adds value to existing screening procedures and is likely to be useful for identification of cases of critical congenital heart defects,"" he said.

Dr David Elliman, from the UK National Screening Committee, said the screening programme for infants was being reviewed and ""this research will form an integral part of that review"".

Now scientists have shown just how strong the instinct really is.

People playing rock-paper-scissors were more likely to match their opponent's gesture when they could see them, they found. The phenomenon persisted even if there was a penalty.

Richard Cook, from University College London, said: 'From the moment we're born, our parents imitate our noises and facial expressions. 

This causes the impulse to imitate to become so ingrained it is often subconscious.'

In some test games, both players were blindfolded. In others, just one was blindfolded.

 They were told the winner would get a cash bonus. But if the game was tied, no player would get a bonus.

They found a 'clear tendency' for the sighted player to choose the same gesture as the blindfolded one, despite the financial loss.

The impulse may persist because it acts as a 'social glue', helping people empathise with each other.",,"{""Richard Cook"": 1}","{""University College London"": 1}","{""Richard Cook"": 1}","{""University College London"": 1}"

However, only genuine laughter does the trick.

While a polite titter may keep others happy, it does nothing to raise levels of feel-good endorphins, say the Oxford University scientists.

Professor Robin Dunbar, one of Britain's leading evolutionary biologists, recorded the amount of laughter produced when his subjects watched comedy videos on television, and during comedy routines at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

Their laughter levels were compared with those who watched factual clips or drama.

Professor Dunbar then assessed their pain tolerance.

Tests included measuring how long they could stand a frozen wine cooler sleeve on their arm, and how long they could stand with their backs against a wall and their legs at right angles.

The results, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, revealed that those who watched comedy in a group laughed the most and had a heightened pain tolerance.

The researchers said: 'Laughing is physically very exhausting, and anything that taxes the body physically triggers endorphins as a natural response as part of the pain control mechanism.'

However, only real laughter works. Professor Dunbar said: 'We think the effect only comes from full-blown hearty laughter, which involves a series of sharp exhalations with no in-drawing of breath.'","{""Proceedings of the Royal Society B"": 1}","{""Robin Dunbar"": 1, ""Dunbar"": 2}","{""Oxford University"": 1, ""Proceedings"": 1, ""the Royal Society B"": 1}","{""Dunbar"": 2}","{""Oxford University"": 1, ""Proceedings"": 1, ""the Royal Society B"": 1}"

15-11-014_express,2011-09-14,It's no joke - a belly laugh really is good for you,"A GOOD laugh really is the best medicine, say scientists.

Belly laughing for 15 minutes releases endorphins that increase our threshold to pain and leave us with a feeling of euphoria.

It has to be a full-bodied laugh, however, and shared with others.

A polite titter on your own is unlikely to do any good at all.

After 10 years of research to find out what controls our tolerance to pain, scientists discovered one answer by sitting volunteers down in front of a TV to watch Mr Bean.

Another group watched factual shows and clips on how to play golf.

Others were sent into the ""wild"", to watch stand-up comedians or staged drama productions at last month's Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

The volunteers were then subjected to levels of pain - using ice-cold sleeves, blood pressure cuffs and arduous work-outs.

Those who had enjoyed a good laugh at either the TV or live comedy shows had at least 10 per cent more tolerance to pain than those who had watched the more serious fare on offer.

Professor Robin Dunbar, of Oxford University, said: ""Very little research has been done into why we laugh and what role it plays in society.

We were able to record each of the participants and found that in a comedy show, they laughed for about a third of the time, and their pain tolerance rose.

""We think that it is the bonding effects of the endorphin rush that explain why laughter plays such an important role in our social lives.""

Studies have shown that laughter is 30 times more likely to occur if someone is in a group rather than alone.

The fact that the endorphin rush appears to be limited to a good belly laugh, shared with others, suggests that laughter has evolved as a way of promoting socialising between humans, Prof Dunbar said.

15-11-014_independent,2011-09-14,Laughter really is the best medicine,"A rattling good laugh with friends will help you deal with pain thanks to opiate-like chemicals that flood the brain, according to a British study released on Wednesday.

Researchers carried out lab experiments in which volunteers watched either comedy clips from ""Mr Bean"" or ""Friends,"" or non-humorous items such as golf or wildlife programmes, while their resistance to mild pain was monitored.

Another test was conducted at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, where the volunteers watched either a stand-up comedy show or a theatrical drama.

In lab conditions, the pain came from a deep-frozen wine-cooler sleeve which was slipped onto the arm or from a blood-pressure cuff that was pumped to the threshold of tolerance.

For the Fringe Festival, the volunteers were asked to do a tough exercise - leaning against the wall with their legs at right angles, as if sitting on a straight-backed chair - before and immediately after the performance, to see if laughter had helped with the pain.

Just 15 minutes of laughter increased the level of pain tolerance by around 10 percent, the study found.

In the lab experiments, the neutral, non-funny programming had no pain-alleviating effect at all. Nor did watching drama at the Fringe Festival.

However, the study notes two important distinctions.

The only laughter that worked was relaxed, unforced laughter that creases the eyes, as opposed to a polite titter.

And this kind of belly laugh is far likelier to happen when you are with others, rather than being alone.

""Very little research has been done into why we laugh and what role it plays in society,"" said Robin Dunbar, head of the Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology at the University of Oxford.

""Using microphones, we were able to record each of the participants and found that in a comedy show, they laughed for about a third of the time, and their pain tolerance rose as a consequence.""

The protection apparently comes from endorphins, a complex chemical that helps to transmit messages between neurons but also dulls signals of physical pain and psychological stress.

Endorphins are the famous product of physical exercise - they help create the ""buzz"" that comes from running, swimming, rowing, yoga and so on.

In laughter, the release comes from an involuntary, repeated muscular exertion that comes from exhaling without drawing a breath, the scientists believe.

The exertion leaves us exhausted and thereby triggers the endorphins.

Great apes are also believed to be able to laugh but, unlike humans, they breathe in as well as out when they do so.

The investigators believe the experiments help to understand the physiological and social mechanism of how laughter is generated.

The group seems vital in unleashing the right kind of endorphin-making laughter, they contend.

Previous studies have focussed more on why humans laugh, as opposed to how they do it.

One theory is that laughter helps transmit mating signals or cements bonding between individuals.

Another idea is that, in a group setting, laughter promotes social cooperation and collective identity. It is thus an evolutionary tool to help survival.

This, they believe, enabled our ancestors to form much larger tribal groupings than the ape-like species that lived alongside them.

The research is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

The experimenters first tested the pain thresholds of volunteers. 

They were then split into two groups, with one being shown 15 minutes of comedy videos, while the other was shown material the researchers deemed boring - such as golfing programmes.

The researchers found that those subjects that had recently experienced belly laughs were able to withstand up to 10% more pain than they had done before watching the videos. 

To their surprise, the scientists also found that the other group was less able to bear pain after watching 15 minutes of the ""boring"" programmes.

Situation comedies 

The type of laughter was also important.

Tittering and giggling did not elicit any physiological effect; only a good guffaw did the job. 

Professor Robin Dunbar of Oxford University, who led the research, believes that uncontrollable laughter releases chemicals called endorphins into the body which, as well as generating mild euphoria, also dull pain.

""It's the emptying of the lungs that causes [this effect],"" he told BBC News. 

""It's exactly what happens when we say 'I laughed until it hurt'.

It seems to be extremely painful and it's that pain that produces the endorphin effect.""

However, not all the comedy programmes were able to hit the spot, according to Prof Dunbar. 

Slapstick humour seemed to score highly whereas clever stand-up comedy routines, though found to be enjoyable, had no effect on raising pain thresholds. 

""I hesitate to say this but we did have one series with [British stand-up comic] Michael McIntyre and we thought he'd go down really well - but it seemed like his humour was too cerebral to produce serious guffaws,"" Prof Dunbar explained. 

""Things that worked very well were slapstick comedies such as Mr Bean. 

""Situation comedies such as Friends also seemed to be particularly successful.""

Spinal Tap 

The researchers were not able to measure endorphin levels directly because that would have involved extracting fluid from the volunteers' spines using a long needle - a process which, Prof Dunbar concedes, would quickly take the smile off their faces and possibly influence the results.

Instead, the researchers took what they referred to as a proxy measurement, which tested the pain threshold for each volunteer. 

This involved, for example, placing a bag of ice on their arms to see how long they could withstand it.

The greater the increase in pain threshold, the greater the amount of endorphins produced.

The aim of Prof Dunbar's study is not to develop a new treatment. 

Instead, it is to explore the role of laughter in the establishment of human societies two million years ago.

All apes are capable of laughter, but it is only humans that are able to belly laugh and so release endorphins. 

Prof Dunbar's theory is that as well as dulling pain, endorphins also make people more susceptible to developing bonds.

""Laughter struck us as such an odd thing,"" he said. 

""We spend so much of our time in conversations trying to elicit laughter and laughing ourselves [so] it looked like the first port of call. 

""At this point what we're trying to show is, yes you do get endorphin activation. 

""The next stage will be to see whether laughing really allows groups to bond together and work as a group better and act more generously towards each other.""

If that is the case, then it may explain why some two million years ago, the first humans were able to form large tribal communities of up to 100 - whereas other apes and ape-like creatures that existed at the time were only able to form communities of up to 50.

This theory creates the scenario of our ancestors sharing laughter around the fire, possibly the emergence of the first clowns, clubbing each other for comic effect.","{""Proceedings of the Royal Society B"": 1}","{""Robin Dunbar"": 1, ""Prof Dunbar"": 2, ""Michael McIntyre"": 1, ""Dunbar"": 2, ""Bean"": 1, ""Prof Dunbar's"": 1}","{""the University of Oxford"": 1, ""the Proceedings of the Royal Society B"": 1, ""Oxford University"": 1, ""BBC News"": 1, ""Friends"": 1, ""Spinal Tap"": 1}","{""Robin Dunbar"": 1, ""Dunbar"": 4, ""Prof Dunbar"": 3, ""Michael McIntyre"": 1, ""Prof Dunbar's"": 1}","{""the University of Oxford"": 1, ""the Proceedings of the Royal Society B"": 1, ""Oxford University"": 1, ""BBC News"": 1}"

Scientists at the University of Leeds scanned blood samples from almost 3,000 Europeans with melanoma and compared them with samples taken from the general population.

One fault was found in the region of a gene called MX2, which has been linked to narcolepsy; another in ATM, which is involved in DNA repair; and the third in CASP8, which plays a role in apoptosis, or programmed cell death.

Having two copies of all three faults Ð one from each parent Ð appears to increase the risk of developing melanoma from one in 60 to one in 46.

07-11-020_guardian,2011-05-27,Safety questions over common treatment for shock in children: Doctors stunned by results of trial carried out in Africa Tests stopped after results showed excess deaths,"A trial in Africa has raised major questions about the safety of the routine treatment given to children suffering from shock in the UK and other developed countries.

It is normal in the UK to inject large amounts of fluid very rapidly into children suffering from shock as a result of, for example, septicaemia (blood poisoning) linked to meningitis.

But doctors testing the feasibility of this fast rehydration in Africa have found that more children treated this way died than among those who were not.

The outcome of the Fluid Expansion As Supportive Therapy (Feast) trial, funded by the UK's Medical Research Council, took doctors by surprise and will lead to a rethink of the practice around the world.

Fluid resuscitation for shock was introduced in Europe and the US several decades ago without a trial, on the basis that it worked for children in shock who were seriously dehydrated from conditions such as gastroenteritis.

The Feast trial was stopped early when the excessive number of deaths became apparent. Scientists are now urging the World Health Organisation, which recommends it, to revisit its guidelines.

While it is possible children are more vulnerable in Africa because of malnutrition and the severity of diseases such as malaria, doctors say there is no clear reason why an injection of a large amount of fluid through a 15-minute drip - known as a bolus - would be more dangerous in Africa than in Europe.

Children in the trial were getting a high standard of care.

It is possible that the potential harm has been masked in rich countries by the availability of ventilators to keep children alive.

The trial is the result of 10 years' work led by Kathryn Maitland, a renowned expert on the use of rehydrating fluids who had hoped to save many children's lives in Africa by introducing what she had thought was a safe treatment.

""Emergencies come into hospital all the time,"" she said.

""Children die within hours of coming into hospital.

Doctors feel powerless.""

Maitland and everybody involved in the research were stunned by what they found.

Because staff in the six participating hospitals - in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania - had been trained in caring for very sick children and had been ensured a constant supply of oxygen and drugs, the death rates among the children generally had gone down.

Doctors assumed it was because of the boluses.

But when the external data monitoring committee looked at the interim results, they told Maitland the trial was being stopped.

Feast monitored the care of 3,170 critically ill children in the six hospitals, all of whom had infections such as malaria and septicaemia which lead to fever.

Those enrolled, with their parents' consent, were divided into three groups.

Two groups were given emergency boluses of 20 to 40 millilitres of fluid per kilogram of bodyweight.

All the children received the normal treatment in Africa, which is the slow administration of fluids through a drip.

The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, show survival rates were better than usual.

Among those not given a bolus, 92.7% survived.

But among the bolus groups, that dropped to 89.4%.

That means boluses caused more than three children to die in every hundred treated.

Experts believe a trial is now needed in a developed-world setting.

""Extrapolating directly from Africa has to be done very carefully,"" said Professor Diana Gibb from the MRC clinical trials unit.

""Here there is a package of care where kids get fluid and if they really don't get better, they will go into intensive care and other things will happen including ventilation.

""But it is also true that a lot of kids in A&E get boluses of fluid if they look particularly unwell and there might be a diagnosis of sepsis.

I suspect because the kids are healthier, it is probably not doing harm but we really don't know the answer to that.""","{""the New England Journal of Medicine"": 1}","{""Kathryn Maitland"": 1, ""Maitland"": 2, ""Diana Gibb"": 1}","{""Medical Research Council"": 1, ""the World Health Organisation"": 1, ""the New England Journal of Medicine"": 1, ""MRC"": 1}","{""Diana Gibb"": 1}","{""Medical Research Council"": 1, ""the World Health Organisation"": 1, ""MRC"": 1}"
07-11-020_bbcnews,2011-05-27,Africa trial questions shock treatment for children,"A trial in East Africa has raised questions about an internationally accepted emergency treatment for children suffering from shock.

It involves injecting a large volume of fluid rapidly, through a drip, and is used widely in Europe and the US.

But researchers say it could be linked to additional deaths of children with severe infections like malaria.

They called for a rethink of UN World Health Organization guidelines that recommend the ""fluid bolus"" treatment.

'Not safe' 

The Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy (Feast) trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, studied 3,170 children in hospitals across Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania.

All children had shock - a potentially fatal condition in which the body restricts the flow of blood to vital organs, shutting down certain organs to spare blood flow for others. 

The children, suffering from fevers and severe infections such as malaria, were allocated to three treatment groups, randomly.

Two groups received rapid rehydration with fluid boluses in the first hour after admission to hospital.

The other group were given fluids more slowly, replacing the amounts needed by a sick child who cannot drink. 

The study, funded by the UK's Medical Research Council, found the children who were given fluid slowly did better. 

The research suggests the addition of boluses led to an extra three child deaths out of every 100 children treated.

""Giving big boluses very quickly to very sick children in the African setting is not safe; however, fluids work if they're given more slowly,"" the principal investigator in Uganda, Professor Sarah Kiguli, told the BBC's Network Africa programme. 

She said there was a need to continue the use of fluid boluses to treat certain types of shock, including those involving burns and trauma and in the treatment of diarrhoea, but the WHO guidelines should be revised in light of the study.

""The results went against recommendations of the WHO and the normal practice in wealthy countries, and this surprised me greatly,"" she added in a statement.

Though the results may not be directly applicable to other areas, where advanced life support equipment is more widely available, the researchers are calling for further investigations into the worldwide use of this treatment.

""The treatment may not carry the same risks in wealthy countries because children are healthier, and in particular have fewer problems of underlying long-standing malnutrition or anaemia,"" Professor Diana Gibb from the Medical Research Council said. 

""However, the clear findings from the Feast trial do question the use of boluses for severe infections even in wealthy countries and more research is needed.""","{""the New England Journal of Medicine"": 1}","{""Sarah Kiguli"": 1, ""Diana Gibb"": 1}","{""UN World Health Organization"": 1, ""The Fluid Expansion"": 1, ""the New England Journal of Medicine"": 1, ""Medical Research Council"": 1, ""BBC"": 1, ""Network Africa"": 1, ""WHO"": 2, ""the Medical Research Council"": 1}","{""Sarah Kiguli"": 1, ""Diana Gibb"": 1}","{""UN World Health Organization"": 1, ""Medical Research Council"": 2, ""BBC"": 1, ""Network Africa"": 1, ""the Medical Research Council"": 1}"
13-11-003_dailymail,2011-01-19,It's worth paying extra for organic milk. . . not just for your health but for the sake of the cows,"Can It be worth paying the extra for a pint of organic milk? 

The difference may be only nine pence, but an average family drinks 12 or so pints a week. 

In a year, that adds up to £56.

So, over the time your children live at home you could pay for a holiday or two simply by sticking to ordinary milk. 

No one will notice the difference in their bowl or glass. 

Though green fanatics insist they prefer the taste of organic milk, formal tests have shown that there’s very little to choose between them on the palate. 

Try both milks on a bowl of cornflakes and you’re unlikely to be able to tell them apart.

But there are other reasons to pay the extra. 

This week, important new research was published by Newcastle University showing that organic milk contains less unhealthy fat, as well as a range of important healthy nutrients. 

The reason? 

Organically-farmed dairy cows are fed mainly on that old-fashioned substance, grass.

The organic movement has a further list of other claims for organic: it’s not just about your health and that of the environment, but also about cows’ welfare, rural jobs and the very shape of the traditional British countryside. 

That’s what the nine pence pint is subsidising.

Are these claims true? 

On human health, there has been a long and acrimonious debate in the dairy industry and government over the advantages of organic milk.  

But that came closer to settlement this week, with the latest piece of research to confirm distinct nutritional benefits. 

WHY GO GREEN?

Organic milk — 52p a pint

Ordinary milk — 43p a pint

One carton in 12 of the 13 million litres of milk we consume in the UK is now organic

The pros

Healthier fats and other nutrients

Fewer chemicals

Children avoid eczema, Omega-3s tackle heart disease

Cows live longer, happier lives

Preserves traditional farming and rural jobs

The cons

No discernible better taste

High demand is leading to imports

9p-a-pint premium costs a two-child family £1,120 over 20 years

Cows less productive

The difference

Organic feed must be 60 per cent grass, hay or silage

Antibiotic use is limited

No herbicides or artificial fertiliser on pastures

Cattle usually traditional breeds, rather than Holstein and Friesian ‘super-cows’

Cows live longer and are less stressed and farms are encouraged to preserve the environment

The Newcastle study found that organic milk is 30-40 per cent lower in the more dangerous saturated fats than standard milk, but higher in the crucial Omega-3 fatty acids.

These play a crucial role in lowering the risk of heart disease, and, in the young, may help in healthy brain and sight development.   

They’re present in oily fish such as herring, but most people take them as expensive supplements.

Research in Holland has shown that if infants and mothers eat organic dairy produce, the children are 36 per cent less likely to develop eczema.

The differences arise because organic cows eat mainly grass, so their milk contains these nutrients — plus extra levels of vitamins. 

You might think all cows eat grass, but the efficient ‘super-cows’ of modern dairy farming exist for much of the year on an unnatural diet of processed food.

About five per cent of British cows never see a meadow at all — the norm in the Unites States. 

And there are plans to build more giant American-style dairy farms for thousands of cows in Britain, simply for efficiency.

The feed given to conventional cows outside the summer season is made from rape meal, beans or peas and from imported soya and maize. 

Waste material from the food manufacturing industry is used and so are the leftovers of grain used in brewing.

But at least 60 per cent of the diet of organic cows has to be organically grown grass and its traditional derivatives — silage and hay. 

It is certainly true we don’t drink the milk our grandparents did. 

One study comparing the chemical composition of milk and cheese in 1940 with that of 2002 found significant reductions in levels of minerals such as iron, magnesium and calcium.

‘What cows are fed has a big influence on milk quality,’ says Gillian Butler, livestock project manager for the Nafferton Ecological Farming Group at Newcastle University. 

‘This research shows that letting cows graze naturally is the most important reason for the differences in composition between organic and conventional milk.’

Less well proven is the organic industry’s claim that its milk is better for you because it contains fewer chemicals. 

But it’s true that the mass of pesticides and other drugs necessary in industrial dairy farming are not allowed or strictly limited in organic.

Pesticides are banned in organic farming, and artificial fertiliser is not necessary because plants such as clover are grown that help enrich the soil. 

Use of antibiotics to treat cows is controlled — but they are less likely to be used because living conditions for organic cows are less crowded.   

Conventionally-farmed cows may suffer diseases of the feet from standing indoors in excrement. 

They may be kept in cubicles, leading to stress and injury. 

And the cows, producing ten times the milk they would do naturally, get ill and have very short lives.

Phil Stocker of the organic overseeing body, the Soil Association, points out that the huge amounts of slurry — excrement — produced by large-scale conventional dairy farms is a nasty hazard as it can end up penetrating the water table. 

Just last week a Devon dairy farmer was fined £1,500 because slurry from his farm had contaminated an important salmon river.

The Soil Association stipulates that organically-farmed cows must graze on pasture in the spring and summer. 

They do live something a little closer to the life of Daisy the Dairy Cow you might recognise from picture books.

For a start they live longer. 

The Holsteins and Friesians cross-bred especially for industrial dairy are five times as productive as the ancient breeds, but they are exhausted often before they’ve had just two or three calves, at about four or five years old. 

Traditional hardy British breeds such as Ayrshire and the Jersey and Guernsey may produce calves and give milk for 12 years.

DairY farming has been in decline, with more than one farmer going out of business every day according to the National Farmers Union. Supermarkets are blamed for increasing their share of the price of each pint, while keeping prices among the lowest in Europe. 

  ‘Over the past decade an awful lot of dairy farmers have faced a choice — go industrial to lower costs, or specialise in organic farming,’ says Phil Stocker, himself a farmer.

‘These farms tend to be smaller and family run. 

They employ more people per cow. 

Organic farming has helped preserve a regional network of these traditional farms. 

Without them, we’ll only see more factory farms like Nocton [the proposed 3,700-cow mega-dairy planned in Linconshire].’

Historians point to the role of small-scale dairy in shaping Britain — providing jobs in rural communities, and with structures from dairy sheds to hedges and stone field walls giving the countryside the shape we treasure.      

So the verdict seems to be — spend 9p extra a pint and save Daisy the Dairy Cow, in her straw hat.

13-11-003_independent,2011-01-17,"Organic milk is better for you, say scientists","Britain's beleaguered organic sector receives a boost today with a study that suggests organic milk is healthier than the ordinary variety.

The European Union-funded study analysed 22 brands sold in supermarkets and found that organic milk had lower levels of harmful saturated fats and more beneficial fatty acids than conventional milk.

While the Newcastle University study stopped short of saying that consumers should switch to organic milk, the lead researcher, Gillian Butler, made that recommendation when discussing her research.

The peer-reviewed paper said the health benefits were present all year round rather than just during the summer, as indicated by research carried out by the same team three years ago into the quality of milk on 25 farms.

It contradicts the Food Standards Agency's (FSA) verdict four years ago that organic milk could contain higher levels of short-chain omega-3 fatty acids but that they were of ""limited health benefit"" compared with the long-chain acids found in oily fish.

Last year an FSA-funded review by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that organic food, produced without chemical fertilisers and pesticides, was no healthier than conventional produce.

Consumption of organic food in Britain has slumped in the past two years amid the economic downturn.

The new study, published in the Journal of Dairy Science, sampled 22 brands, 10 of them organic, between 2006 and 2008. 

Mrs Butler, the livestock project manager for the Nafferton Ecological Farming Group, said: ""We wanted to check if what we found on farms also applies to milk available in the shops. 

Surprisingly, the differences between organic and conventional milk were even more marked. 

Whereas on the farms the benefits of organic milk were proven in the summer but not the winter, in the supermarkets it is significantly better quality all year round.""

She linked the lower quality of conventional milk to a lower reliance on grazing and chemical fertilisers' suppression of clover. 

Conventional milk also varied more in nutritional content.

""The results suggest greater uniformity of feeding practice on farms supplying organic milk, since there were no brands which differed consistently in fat composition,"" said Mrs Butler. 

""We were surprised to see obvious differences between the conventional brands, with the more expensive ones not necessarily better.

""Switching to organic milk and dairy products provides a natural way to increase our intake of nutritionally desirable fatty acids, vitamins and antioxidants without increasing our intake of less desirable fatty acids,"" Mrs Butler said.

07-11-011_express,2011-03-07,17 gene finds could slash heart attacks,"SCIENTISTS have made a series of landmark discoveries that could revolutionise the treatment of heart disease.

Medical experts have identified 17 previously unknown genetic causes of conditions that can lead to heart attacks or strokes.

Previous studies have shown that up to 40 per cent of heart disease cases can be prevented by lifestyle changes such as taking exercise, improving diet and giving up smoking.

But around half of those at risk are thought to be people who are born with genetic defects.

Coronary heart disease claims more than 90,000 lives each year in the UK. Although the numbers have been falling since the late 1970s, Britain still has one of the highest heart disease death rates in western Europe.

The latest findings come from three studies on the genetic links to coronary artery disease, CARDIoGRAM, C4D and one in China, and are published in the journal Nature Genetics.

Scientists around the world collected data on thousands of DNA samples to find genetic variants associated with heart conditions.

Professor Nilesh Samani, of Leicester University, who jointly led CARDIoGRAM, said: ""Understanding how these genes work will vastly improve our knowledge of how the disease develops, and could ultimately help to develop new treatments.""

Professor Hugh Watkins, of Oxford University, a member of the C4D team, said: ""Our research strengthens the argument that lots of genes have a small effect on your heart disease risk, rather than a few genes having a large effect.

Being able to identify people at risk from a future heart attack has taken a step closer to reality after the biggest ever study of its kind discovered over a dozen genes associated with the condition.","Scientists from all over the world, including Britain, studied the genetic make up of more than 140,000 people to find DNA faults in those susceptible to coronary heart disease. 

They discovered 13 new genes associated with the risk – doubling the number already known. 

The findings could lead to new treatments for the disease and open the possibility of diagnosing those at risk from the condition in the future. 

Professor Nilesh Samani, of the British Heart Foundation and the University of Leicester, who co-led the international research programme, said most of genes identified were not previously known to be involved in the development of coronary heart disease, 

Professor Samani said: ""The most exciting thing about our study is that we have discovered several new genes not previously known to be involved in the development of coronary heart disease, which is the main cause of heart attacks. 

""Understanding how these genes work, which is the next step, will vastly improve our knowledge of how the disease develops, and could ultimately help to develop new treatments."" 

The study involved over 167 clinicians and scientists from UK, Europe, Iceland, USA and Canada and more than 140,000 participants. 

The researchers assessed the genetic codes of people to search for variations in DNA that are more likely to be found in people with coronary heart disease. 

Professor Peter Weissberg, Medical Director at the BHF, added: ""As more and more large scale genetic studies are carried out we are beginning to identify genes that may play a significant, though small, role in the development of heart disease. 

""Each new gene identified brings us a small step closer to understanding the biological mechanisms of cardiovascular disease development and potential new treatments."" 

Interestingly, only three of the 13 new gene regions appear to be linked to coronary disease through traditional risk factors such as high cholesterol and blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and obesity. 

Heart and circulatory disease is the biggest killer in Britain and heart disease alone causes 91,000 deaths a year. 

It is thought around six million people are taking statins to reduce levels of LDL-cholesterol in their blood which is a major risk for heart disease and 2.6 million people have been diagnosed with heart disease. 

Meanwhile scientists have identified a single mutated gene that causes Hajdu-Cheney syndrome, a disorder of the bones causing progressive bone loss and osteoporosis or fragile bones. 

The study gives vital insight into possible causes of osteoporosis and highlights the gene as a potential target for treating the condition. 

There are only 50 reported cases of Hajdu-Cheney syndrome (HCS), of which severe osteoporosis is a main feature. 

Osteoporosis is a condition leading to reduction in bone strength and susceptibility to fractures. 

It is the most common bone disease, with one in two women and one in five men over 50 in the UK fracturing a bone because of the condition. 

The team of scientists, led by King's College London and Guy's and St Thomas', identified NOTCH2 as the gene.

At least 17 previously unknown genetic variants have been identified that increase the risk of narrowed arteries and blood clots - the main cause of heart attacks and strokes.

The findings from three new studies, published in the journal Nature Genetics, double the known genetic causes of heart disease.

Researchers hope they will lead to better ways of identifying those most at risk and to new approaches to treating heart disease by targeting specific genes and molecules.

Previous studies have shown that up to 40 per cent of heart disease cases can be prevented by lifestyle measures such as taking exercise, improving diet and giving up smoking. But about 50 per cent of the risk of heart disease is thought to be due to genetic factors people are born with.

Heart and artery disease is the world's biggest killer, causing about 12 per cent of all deaths worldwide. Coronary heart disease claims more than 90,000 lives each year in the UK. Although the numbers have fallen rapidly since the late 1970s, Britain still has one of the highest death rates in western Europe.

In Scotland, 3.3 per cent of the population is thought to have heart disease, and in 2009-10 there were almost 11,500 heart attacks recorded.

For the latest study, scientists around the world collected data on many thousands of DNA samples to find genetic variants associated with disease in arteries supplying blood to the heart.

For the largest of the new studies, known as CardioGram, scientists pooled information on more than 140,000 people and identified 13 new genetic ""loci"" - regions of DNA containing genes - linked to the disease.

Only three of the gene regions appeared to involve traditional risk factors such as high cholesterol and blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and obesity.

Five genetic risk factors were pinpointed by a similar study called C4D conducted by the Coronary Artery Disease Genetics Consortium which looked at data from more than 70,000 DNA samples.

The third study, led by researchers in China, focused on more than 7,000 individuals of Han Chinese ancestry and identified one gene variant.

Professor Nilesh Samani, from the University of Leicester, who co-led CardioGram, said: ""Understanding how these genes work, which is the next step, will vastly improve our knowledge of how the disease develops, and could ultimately help to develop new treatments.""

Genetics: While lifestyle factors can help reduce the risk of heart disease, genes are also important. Around 50 per cent of the risk of heart disease is thought to be due to the genes people are born with.

Smoking: Carbon monoxide in smoke and nicotine put a strain on the heart by making it work faster. Other chemicals in cigarette smoke damage the lining of the coronary arteries.

High blood pressure: Puts a strain on the heart and can lead to heart disease if not properly controlled.

Cholesterol: Essential for healthy cells, but if there is too much in the blood it can lead to heart disease. Low-density lipoproteins take cholesterol from the liver and deliver it to cells. It tends to build up on the walls of the coronary arteries.

Diabetes: High glucose levels in the blood affect the walls of the arteries, making them more likely to develop fatty deposits. Diabetes increases the damage done by someof the major risk factors for coronary heart disease such as smoking, high blood pressureand high cholesterol.

Modified versions of the dance club drug may help to fight leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma.

Six years ago researchers found that cancers affecting white blood cells responded to psychotropic drugs including ecstasy, weight-loss pills and anti-depressants.

The University of Birmingham team has now adapted ecstasy to be 100 times deadlier to cancerous cells.

Further work could lead to ecstasy, which is an amphetamine derivative properly known as MDMA, being trialled on patients.

Dr David Grant, of the charity Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research, which helped fund the study, said: 'The prospect of being able to target blood cancer with a drug derived from ecstasy is genuinely exciting.

This is a significant step.'

Professor John Gordon, from the university's School of Immunology and Infection, said it was 'an exciting step', adding: 'The results hold the potential for improvements in treatments in years to come.'

He said the scientists had their work cut out adapting ecstasy.

It may help save thousands of lives each year.

Scientists at the University of Birmingham have discovered that a reworked form of the drug MDMA - commonly known as Ecstasy - has potential as a cancer-killing agent for treating leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma.

Research published online in the j ournal Investigational New Drugs reveals significant success in ""redesigning the designer drug"" which they now hope can be produced in a safe form to treat patients.

Six years ago scientists at the university found that half of the cancers affecting white blood cells responded in the test tube to the growth-suppressing properties of ""psychotropic"" drugs.

These included weight loss pills, Prozac-type anti-depressants, and amphetamine derivatives such as MDMA.

Professor John Gordon, of the university's School of Immunology and Infection, said: ""This is an exciting next step towards using a modified form of MDMA to help people suffering from blood cancer.

""Further work is required but this research is a significant step forward in developing a potential new cancer drug.""

According to the latest statistics almost 12,000 people are diagnosed with blood cancers.

They kill nearly 26,000 each year.

Chemotherapy is currently the main course of treatment for blood cancers.

But in many cases it will fail because the cancer cells have developed defences against the drugs.

One of the major problems in creating new treatments for blood cancers is that high levels of a key protein called BCL2 protect the cancer cells from being killed.

The new Ecstasy-based treatment can bypass this defence mechanism.","{""Investigational New Drugs"": 1}","{""John Gordon"": 1, ""David Grant"": 1}","{""the University of Birmingham"": 1, ""Investigational New Drugs"": 1, ""School of Immunology and Infection"": 1, ""Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research"": 1}",,"{""the University of Birmingham"": 1, ""Investigational New Drugs"": 1, ""School of Immunology and Infection"": 1, ""Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research"": 1}"

01-11-015_bbcnews,2011-08-19,Modified ecstasy 'attacks blood cancers',"Modified ecstasy could one day have a role to play in fighting some blood cancers, according to scientists.

Ecstasy is known to kill some cancer cells, but scientists have increased its effectiveness 100-fold, they said in Investigational New Drugs journal.

Their early study showed all leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma cells could be killed in a test tube, but any treatment would be a decade away.

A charity said the findings were a ""significant step forward"".

In 2006, a research team at the University of Birmingham showed that ecstasy and anti-depressants such as Prozac had the potential to stop cancers growing.

The problem was that it needed doses so high they would have been fatal if given to people. 

The researchers, in collaboration with the University of Western Australia, have chemically re-engineered ecstasy by taking some atoms away and putting new ones in their place.

One variant increased cancer-fighting effectiveness 100-fold.

It means that if 100g of un-modified ecstasy was needed to get the desired effect, only 1g of the modified ecstasy would be needed to have the same effect.

Scientists say this also reduced the toxic effect on the brain.

Lead researcher Professor John Gordon, from the University of Birmingham, told the BBC: ""Against the cancers, particularly the leukaemia, the lymphoma and the myeloma, where we've tested these new compounds we can wipe out 100% of the cancer cells in some cases. 

""We would really need to pinpoint which are the most sensitive cases, but it has the potential to wipe out all the cancer cells in those examples. 

""This is in the test tube, it could be different in the patient, but for now it's quite exciting."" 

'Soapy' cells 

It is believed that the drug is attracted to the fat in the membranes of the cancerous cells. 

Researchers think it makes the cells ""a bit more soapy"", which can break down the membrane and kill the cell.

They said cancerous cells were more susceptible than normal, healthy ones. 

However, doctors are not going to start prescribing modified ecstasy to cancer patients in the near future.

The research has been demonstrated only in samples in a test tube.

Animals studies and clinical trials would be needed before prescribing a drug could be considered. 

First, however, chemists in the UK and Australia are going to try to tweak the modified ecstasy even further as they think it can be made even more potent.

'Genuinely exciting' 

If everything is successful, a drug is still at least a decade away.

Academics at Bangor University in North Wales say their study has shown for the first time that overweight and obese people have a 'dulled' sensitivity to the drinks, but enhanced 'subconscious liking' of the sweet taste.

Hans-Peter Kubis, of the university's School of Sport, Health & Exercise Sciences, has called for sugar to be taxed to stop an impending health 'disaster', and for fruit juice to be taken out of the 'five-a-day' health message.

He said: 'This has serious implications for public health. This research shows how little sweet food stuffs are required to actually change your taste perceptions and how powerful sweet tasting products are.

'We are headed for a multi-level health disaster with rising obesity levels and the increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes.

'From our research it's clear to see how this situation may have created a cycle of sweet food and drink consumption. As taste satisfaction levels drop, the more sweet foods are consumed, contributing to these problems.'

 

Researchers are encouraging parents to give their children water instead of 'healthy' fruit drinks.

Natural fruit juice, as well as carbonated drinks and cordials, are all 'too high in sugar and too sweet', according to the findings.

Dr Kubis said: 'My reaction would be to encourage the Government to consider taxing sugar that is added to food stuffs - and have that tax ring-fenced for the health budget.

'I'd also question the wisdom of including fruit juice in the five-a-day message. Fruit juice is higher in sugars than people realise.'

In the trial, lean and obese people were asked to rate their perception of and enjoyment of sweet and salty tastes.

The initial trial showed that overweight and obese participants rated drinks as being less sweet than the lean participants.

In further experiments the subconscious preference for sweet food underwent a computer-based test finding that overweight and obese participants had a stronger preference for sweet. The conclusion was that overweight and obese participants had a 'reduced sensitivity' to sweetness but an 'enhanced subconscious preference' for sweet food.

To test whether sweet food consumption may be responsible for these findings and to see if it was possible to recreate the taste perception of obese people in those of a 'normal' weight, people who did not usually consume sugary drinks were recruited for a second experiment.

Researchers found that in as little as four weeks it was possible to replicate the dulling of the 'sweetness' of sugary drinks and lessen the enjoyment, just by repeated consumption.

Twelve people who did not usually drink sweet drinks and were lean were recruited for the sugary drink study.

02-11-023_express,2011-06-10,HIDDEN DANGER IN FRUIT JUICES,"MILLIONS of people are putting their health at risk after research showed that natural fruit juice is so packed with sugar it can be addictive.

Drinking just two glasses a day could give people a ""sweet tooth"", making them crave calorie-packed food, a study claimed yesterday. Experts are so concerned they are even calling for juice drinks to be taxed in a bid to curb Britain's growing obesity epidemic.

Dr Hans-Peter Kubis, who led the study, said: ""This has serious implications for public health. The research shows how few sweet foodstuffs are required to actually change your taste perceptions and how powerful sweettasting products are.

""We are heading for a multi-level health disaster with rising obesity levels and the increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes.""

Pure fruit juice, as well as carbonated drinks and cordials, are all ""too high in sugar and too sweet"", the study found.

The market for fruit juice and juice drinks was valued at a massive GBP 3.1billion in 2009.

Figures show that Britons work their way through more than two billion litres of fruit juice each year, the equivalent of 36 litres for every man, woman and child.

Drinking natural fruit juice is widely regarded as a healthy way to start the day, with many enjoying a glass as part of their recommended five-a-day intake of fruit and vegetables.

But that view is now being disputed after previous research showed that just one glass of orange juice a day increases the risk of type 2 diabetes linked to poor diet by up to a quarter. It is thought the lack of fibre in juices may cause dangerous spikes in blood sugar levels.

The latest study showed that overweight people who drink sugary drinks are left with a ""dulled"" sensitivity to them and their sweet taste. This then leads to an enhanced ""subconscious liking"" for the sweetness, making them prefer and even crave high-calorie and sugar-laden foods.

A vicious cycle is then created as they become more dependent on the sugar rush and desperate for their next ""treat"".

Researchers say it is the first time such a link has been established.

And it is not just the overweight who are susceptible. The study found that people who are slim and active also risk developing a sweet tooth after having just two sugary drinks every day for a month.

Low or zero-calorie drinks with artificial sweeteners do not solve the problem as they only encourage people to over-eat at the next opportunity to make up for the calories missing in the beverage.

Dr Kubis, from the University of Bangor's school of sport, health and exercise sciences, said: ""I would encourage the Government to consider taxing sugar that is added to foodstuffs and have that tax ring-fenced for the health budget.

""I'd also question the wisdom of including fruit juice in the five-a-day message.""

The research was carried out at Bangor in collaboration with Bristol University's school of physiology and pharmacology.

In the study's first phase, overweight participants were found to rate sugary drinks as being less sweet than slimmer adults as well as having a stronger subconscious preference for sweet food. In the second phase, lean people who did not usually drink sweet drinks drank two sugary beverages every day for four weeks.

The results showed their enjoyment and sensitivity of sweet taste became dulled after consuming the drinks, mimickin g findings shown in the obese participants.

But Richard Laming, of the British Soft Drinks Association, slammed the research.

He said: ""It is wrong to draw sweeping conclusions from this experiment that involved only 12 subjects, with no control group, consuming an artificially unbalanced diet.

""The experience of millions of people every day, that soft drinks can be consumed as part of a balanced diet, still stands.

""Fruit juice contains only the sugar that was in the original fruit.

The research suggests that within a month those who drink sugary beverages are left with a dulled sensitivity to sweet tastes. This leads to an increased preference for high-calorie and sugar-laden foods, creating a ""vicious cycle"" as consumers look for their next treat.

Those who do not have a sweet tooth are particularly at risk of developing one after drinking sugary beverages, even if they are slim and active.

Experts who carried out the research at the universities of Bristol and Bangor expressed surprise at how quickly tastes could be dulled by exposure to sweet drinks. Lucy Donaldson, of the University of Bristol, said: ""We have known for some time that the way we perceive different tastes can change under different circumstances. Finding that two sweet drinks a day over a short time can dramatically change taste was a real surprise.""

In the trial lean and obese people rated their perception and enjoyment of sweet and salty tastes. The obese participants tended to rate identical drinks as less sweet than the lean ones did.

The experts then recruited only lean people who did not usually consume sugary drinks. Their sensitivity to sweet drinks was tested and they were asked to consume a sugary drink twice a day. A month later, when they were re-tested, their sensitivity to sweet tastes and conscious enjoyment of them had dulled.

Researchers say the UK government should consider taxing sugar added to foodstuffs.

They claim overweight people have a dulled sensitivity to soft drinks but enhanced subconscious liking for sweet things.

The Soft Drinks Association said too much of anything is not a good idea.

Dr Hans-Peter Kubis, who led the research team, said it has ""serious implications"" for health.

He says a failure to address the problem could lead to rising obesity levels and more type 2 diabetes. 

The researchers say if children are thirsty they should drink water as even squash and natural fruit juice are high in sugar.

Researchers, who undertook trials with people of different weight, say their work shows, for the first time, that overweight and obese people have a dulled sensitivity to soft drinks.

But they also develop enhanced subconscious liking of sweet tastes.

Even for those who are not overweight, drinking two sugary drinks a day for four weeks is sufficient to dull people's sensitivity to the taste sensation.

This reduces the enjoyment of the taste, but increases the person's preference for it.

As the sweet 'treat' becomes less rewarding, the tendency is then to look for more sweet food, or drink, and a ""vicious circle"" of eating sweet and calorie laden food is established.

The sweet drinks not only include soft drinks however, as levels of sugar found in fruit cordial or 'squash' and natural fruit juice as well as carbonated drinks are all ""too high in sugar and too sweet,"" says the Bangor study.

""This has serious implications for public health,"" said Dr Hans-Peter Kubis, from Bangor University's school of sport, health and exercise sciences.

11-11-001_sun,2011-05-06,Satisfied with life? It's down to genes,"SCIENTISTS have found a ""happiness gene"" in the brain which they believe is the key to our basic level of contentment.

The gene - called 5-HTT - comes in ""long"" and ""short"" versions.

People who inherit two long copies, one from each parent, tend to be the most content.

People with two short versions are the least satisfied with their lot, the UK study revealed.

Experts from the London School of Economics analysed genetic data from more than 2,500 people. 

Their results showed 35 per cent of people with two long genes were ""very satisfied"" with life, compared with just 19 per cent of those with two ""shorts"".

11-11-001_guardian,2011-05-06,Happiness linked to a gene that comes in long and short versions,"Your overall happiness may depend in part on whether you drew the long or short version of a gene, say researchers

In work that gives cranky teenagers another reason to blame their parents for all life's woes, researchers have uncovered a genetic link to happiness.

The study of more than 2,500 Americans revealed two variants of a gene that influenced how satisfied - or dissatisfied - people were with their lot.

Those born with two long versions of the gene (one is passed down from each parent) were more likely to declare themselves ""very satisfied"" with life than those who inherited two short versions.

The study marks a tentative step towards explaining the mystery of why some people seem naturally happier than others.

""This gives us more insight into the biological mechanisms that influence life satisfaction,"" said Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, a researcher at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

""If you're feeling down, you can say it's your biology telling you life is less rosy that it is,"" he added.

A greater understanding of happiness genes might in future allow would-be parents to create a child who will be more satisfied with their life.

Happiness is only partly influenced by genetic makeup. 

Studies in twins suggest that genes account for roughly a third to a half of the variation in happiness between people. 

It is not yet known how many genes affect how cheerful we are.

De Neve looked at the genetic makeup of 2,574 people selected to be representative of the general population, whose medical histories were recorded for the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. 

Among the records were answers to a question participants were asked in their early 20s about life satisfaction.

In response to the question, ""How satisfied are you with your life as a whole"", they answered either ""very satisfied"", ""satisfied"", ""neither satisfied or dissatisfied"", ""dissatisfied"" or ""very dissatisfied"".

Writing in the Journal of Human Genetics, De Neve describes how roughly 40% said they were ""very satisified"" with life, and among these, 35.4% had two long variants of the gene and only 19.1% had two short versions. 

Of those who were ""dissatisfied"" with life, 26.2% had two long variants of the gene, while 20% had two short versions. 

That indicates a slight over-representation of the long variants in happier people.

The gene, known as 5-HTT, is involved with the transport of serotonin, a feelgood chemical, in the brain. 

The longer variant leads to more efficient release and recycling of the neurotransmitter.

De Neve calculated that, everything else being equal, having one long version of the gene increased the number of people claiming to be ""very satisfied"" with life by around 8.5%. Having two long versions raised the number by 17.3%.

In unpublished work, De Neve and other researchers have since replicated the result in a separate group of people.

De Neve urged caution over the result, however, and emphasised that inheriting two short versions of the gene did not condemn a person to a life of misery any more than two long versions would make someone impervious to sadness.

""This gene has an important influence, but you cannot say it causes happiness. Happiness is hugely complex and your experiences throughout the course of your life will remain the dominant force on that,"" he said.

A 2009 study by Elaine Fox at the University of Essex suggested that people who carried long versions of the 5-HTT gene had a greater tendency to focus on the positives in life. 

The ""bright side"" version of the gene might bolster people's resilience to stressful events, and protect against anxiety, depression and other mental health problems.

Ed Diener, a psychologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and author of the 2008 book, Happiness: Unlocking the Mysteries of Psychological Wealth, said: ""We are just beginning to understand the actual genetics of happiness, and how genes might influence brain hormones and other physiology that influence our well-being.

11-11-001_independent,2011-05-06,Discovered: the genetic secret of a happy life,"SOME PEOPLE are born happy, scientists say. Researchers have identified a ""happiness gene"" that makes people more likely to feel satisfied with their lives.

 Their sunny dispostion is an accident of birth, at least in part.

Those who carry the less efficient version of the gene are more likely to be pessimistic. 

Their tendency to see the glass half empty is equally a part of their inheritance.

The finding is the first to demonstrate a link between the gene, called 5-HTT, and satisfaction. 

People with the long version are more likely to be cheerful while sulkiness is the default position of those with the short version. 

Knowing which version of the gene they carry may help people improve their mood.

Jan-Emmanual De Neve, a behavioural economist at the London School of Economics, which led the study, said: ""In five or 10 years, people will be able to read their genome. 

If you find you have a predisposition to see the glass as half empty then when you feel down, you may think 'Maybe my biology is fooling me into thinking my situation is less rosy than it is.' 

That combined with your own will power may help you get out of the psychological dip and go above and beyond. 

Knowledge is power.""

The 5-HTT gene, which regulates the brain chemical serotonin, has been indirectly linked with happiness before.

In research published in 2009, scientists showed that people with the long version of the gene had a subliminal tendency to avoid negative images and select positive ones.

They concluded that the gene contributed to ""attentional bias in the selection of emotional stimuli"".

The new study, in the Journal of Human Genetics, goes further by linking the gene with life satisfaction, now recognised as fundamental to happiness. 

More than 2,500 adults in their twenties were asked how satisfied they were with their life. 

Those with two long versions of the gene were 17 per cent more likely to say they were very satisfied.","{""Journal of Human Genetics"": 1}","{""Jan-Emmanual De Neve"": 1}","{""the London School of Economics"": 1}","{""Jan-Emmanual De Neve"": 1}","{""the London School of Economics"": 1}"
14-11-018_dailymail,2011-08-03,PROZAC 'INCREASES RISK OF DEATH IN OVER-65S',"OLDER people taking drugs such as Prozac and Seroxat to combat depression are more at risk of serious health problems than those regularly using old-style antidepressants, warn researchers.

The most widely prescribed antidepressants Ð known as SSRIs Ð are more likely to cause death and heart attacks, strokes, falls and seizures than the older tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), they found.

Researchers from the universities of Nottingham and East Anglia say tricyclics may be the safest class of antidepressants for older people, partly because they are prescribed in lower doses which are just as effective.

The study, published in the British Medical Journal, analysed treatment and side effects recorded for more than 60,000 people aged 65 and over who were diagnosed with depression between 1996 and 2007.

Those patients not taking any antidepressants had a 7 per cent risk of dying from any cause but this rose to 8.1 per cent for those taking TCAs and 10.6 per cent for SSRIs.

The risk was even higher, at 11.4 per cent, for other types of antidepressants such as venlafaxine and mirtazapine.

The risks of stroke and fracture were noticeably higher in those taking SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) compared to TCAs, which include drugs like amitriptyline and lofepramine.

SSRIs were linked to the most falls of any drugs.

The risk to the patient was highest in the first 28 days after starting treatment, and in the first 28 days after stopping it.

The study is one of the first to investigate adverse events linked to antidepressants in older people, who may be more vulnerable because they often take other drugs for other conditions and because age-related changes in the body mean they are less able to cope with side effects.

More than 41million prescriptions for antidepressants were issued on the NHS last year.

Almost 23million were for SSRIs such as Prozac and Seroxat, a 43 per cent rise in four years.

The researchers warn that the risks and benefits of different antidepressants should be evaluated when they are prescribed to older people.

Dr Carol Coupland of Nottingham University said: 'Our study has shown associations but not necessarily a direct causal link, so there is no need for older patients to change or stop their treatments if they are finding them beneficial.

'GPs and older patients taking these medicines should be aware that adverse effects are most common during the first few weeks of treatment, so they should be carefully monitored during this period.'","{""British Medical Journal"": 1}","{""Carol Coupland"": 1}","{""the British Medical Journal"": 1, ""NHS"": 1, ""Prozac"": 1, ""Seroxat"": 1, ""Nottingham University"": 1}",,"{""Nottingham University"": 1}"
07-11-033_dailymail,2011-09-20,Does cholesterol hold the key to a vaccine against Aids? Scientists find way to stop HIV damaging the immune system,"Scientists have made a breakthrough they believe may offer a new hope in developing a vaccine against Aids.

Researchers from the United States and Europe have found a way to prevent HIV from damaging the immune system.

The have found it is unable to attack the immune system if cholesterol is removed from the virus's membrane.

'It's like an army that has lost its weapons but still has flags, so another army can recognise it and attack it,' said Adriano Boasso of Imperial College London, who led the study.

The team now plans to investigate how to use this way of inactivating the virus and possibly develop it into a vaccine.

Usually when a person becomes infected with HIV, the body's innate immune response puts up an immediate defence. 

But some researchers believe HIV causes the innate immune system to overreact. 

This weakens the immune system's next line of defence, known as the adaptive immune response. 

For this study -- published yesterday in the journal Blood -- Boasso's team removed cholesterol from the membrane around the virus and found that this stopped HIV from triggering the innate immune response. 

This in turn led to a stronger adaptive response, orchestrated by a type of immune cells called T cells.

Aids kills around 1.8 million people a year worldwide. An estimated 2.6 million people caught HIV in 2009, and 33.3 million people are living with the virus.

Major producers of current HIV drugs include Gilead Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline. 

Scientists from companies, non-profits and governments around the world have been trying for many years to make a vaccine against HIV but have so far had only limited success.

A 2009 study in Thailand involving 16,000 volunteers showed for the first time that a vaccine could prevent HIV infection in a small number of people, but since the efficacy was only around 30 per cent, researchers were forced back to the drawing board.

An American team working on an experimental HIV vaccine said in May that it helped monkeys with a form of the Aids virus control the infection for more than a year, suggesting it may lead to a vaccine for people.

HIV is spread in many ways -- during sex, on needles shared by drug users, in breast milk and in blood - so there is no single easy way to prevent infection. 

The virus also mutates quickly and can hide from the immune system, and attacks the very cells sent to battle it.

'HIV is very sneaky,' Boasso said in a statement. 'It evades the host's defences by triggering overblown responses that damage the immune system. 

‘It's like revving your car in first gear for too long -- eventually the engine blows out.

He said this may be why developing a vaccine has proven so tricky. 

'Most vaccines prime the adaptive response to recognise the invader, but it's hard for this to work if the virus triggers other mechanisms that weaken the adaptive response.'

HIV takes its membrane from the cell that it infects, the researchers explained in their study. 

This membrane contains cholesterol, which helps keep it fluid and enables it to interact with particular types of cell.

Normally, a subset of immune cells called plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) recognize HIV quickly and react by producing signaling molecules called interferons. 

These signals activate various processes which are initially helpful, but which damage the immune system if switched on for too long.

Working with scientists Johns Hopkins University, the University of Milan and Innsbruck University, Boasso's team found that if cholesterol is removed from HIV's envelope, it can no longer activate pDCs. 

As a result, T cells, which orchestrate the adaptive response, can fight the virus more effectively.","{""Blood"": 1}","{""Adriano Boasso"": 1, ""Boasso"": 3}","{""Imperial College London"": 1, ""Gilead Bristol Myers Squibb"": 1, ""Merck"": 1, ""Pfizer"": 1, ""GlaxoSmithKline"": 1, ""Johns Hopkins University"": 1, ""the University of Milan"": 1, ""Innsbruck University"": 1}","{""Adriano Boasso"": 1, ""Boasso"": 3}","{""Imperial College London"": 1, ""Gilead Bristol Myers Squibb"": 1, ""Merck"": 1, ""Pfizer"": 1, ""GlaxoSmithKline"": 1, ""Johns Hopkins University"": 1, ""the University of Milan"": 1, ""Innsbruck University"": 1}"

02-11-051_express,2011-12-17,Save cash by switching to healthy food,"HAVING a healthy diet can cost people less than eating junk food, according to new research.

It says parents of obese children can save up to £6.58 a week by changing shopping habits. 

The study challenges the main reasons many families give for eating the wrong food - that healthier options cost more.

A research team led by University of Bristol doctors Julian Hamilton-Shield and Debbie Sharp, analysed food diaries kept by the families of obese children.

They measured the cost of substituting healthy for unhealthy food and found it can cost less.

Figures revealed healthier eating can cost up to £2.31 extra a week but savings of £6.58 a week can be made by switching shops.

Reduced They clearly show it is possible to switch to a healthy diet and still reduce costs, says the research published in the Obesity issue of the British Journal of General Practice.

Professor Julian Hamilton-Shield, of Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, who is an expert in child diabetes, obesity and metabolism, said: ""Food cost is frequently cited as a reason for failure to address eating behaviours in clinical practice.

""This study demonstrates that for many this is a perceived rather than a real barrier.""

The food diaries of obese children were analysed for various aspects of nutritional content then converted by qualified dieticians into ""healthier option"" daily menus.

The diaries showed that on average they consumed 221 calories per day more than the estimated average requirements. 

The adjusted healthier menus reduced this to just seven calories above.

Researchers compared the cost of the two menus if bought from budget supermarkets, mid-range supermarkets and local shops.

They concluded that shoppers at a mid-range supermarket eating a diet of low nutritional quality could switch to a healthy diet by shopping at a budget supermarket and still save money. 

Other factors play a part in diet, such as taste preferences and the time people are able to spend cooking.

But the results suggest that as pressure grows on family finances, there are healthy eating options that will not break the bank.","{""British Journal of General Practice"": 1}","{""Julian Hamilton-Shield"": 2, ""Debbie Sharp"": 1}","{""University of Bristol"": 1, ""Obesity"": 1, ""the British Journal of General Practice"": 1, ""Bristol Royal Hospital for Children"": 1}","{""Julian Hamilton-Shield"": 1, ""Debbie Sharp"": 1}","{""University of Bristol"": 1, ""Bristol Royal Hospital for Children"": 1}"
12-11-005_mirror,2011-02-16,North-South divide's life expectancy gap now at a 40-year-high,"AROUND 37,000 more people a year go to their graves early in the North compared with the South, a grim health report reveals today.

 

The death toll in the fatal North-South health divide is the equivalent of a typical crowd at a Premier League football stadium.

Those living in places such as Yorkshire, Lancashire and Tyne & Wear are 20% more likely to die before their time.

Every age group in the North is affected by a higher chance of a premature death.

And the difference in the numbers dying under 75 is at a 40-year high.

The report warns: “The North is being decimated at the rate of a major city every decade.”

The research, by the University of Manchester and Manchester City Council’s joint health unit, says the inequality will worsen as Government cuts ravage jobs in the North.



Professor Iain Buchan, of the university’s School of Community Based Medicine, said: “If you imagine a football stadium full of people who have died early but would not have done had they lived in the South, it is a very sobering view.”

The impact of the recession was “potentially disastrous” for the North, hit hardest by job losses as the Tory-led Coalition targets the public sector for savage cuts.

The South enjoys 25% more disposable income than the North, which is up from 20% 15 years ago.

The geographic divide runs roughly from The Wash in Norfolk to Bristol in the South West – and Prof Buchan said the differences were mainly due to wealth. He warned: “Dealing with this is not something that can be delayed. Focusing social and economic recovery on the North is the only way to tackle this death rate divide.

“It is a misconception to focus on lifestyle issues like eating, drinking and smoking. Those factors account for only a fifth of the problem. It is principally about money and resources, which give people more control over their lives and enable them to make healthier choices.”

The study, published in the British Medical Journal, says the biggest rise has been in the 20 to 34 age group, which has leapt to a 22% difference between North and South from level rates in 1965.

The study collated data from 1965 to 2008 which showed a persistent life expectancy gap of 14% over four decades, with men suffering more at 15% compared with women at 13%.

But the key figure was the current 20% gap in overall deaths under 75.

Prof Buchan said the nation was heading for even deeper health inequality and economic chaos if the divide was not closed.

He added: “In the most deprived areas, there are the fewest number of GPs per head of population. There are fewer GPs in the North where there is a greater need.”

A Department of Health spokeswoman said: “Everyone should have the same opportunity to lead a healthy life, no matter where they live. The Government has made it clear that reducing health inequalities is a priority as part of its commitment to fairness and social justice.”

12-11-005_guardian,2011-02-15,Northerners '20% more likely to die under 75' than southerners,"North-south divide in life expectancy is widest for 40 years and likely to worsen because of recession, researchers say

Some 37,000 people a year die in the north earlier than they might if they had enjoyed the same life chances as those in the south. 

People in the north of England are 20% more likely to die before they reach 75 than those in the south, research has revealed.

The north-south divide in longevity is the widest for 40 years and is likely to worsen because of the recession, according to a study in the British Medical Journal. Every year some 37,000 people die in the north earlier than they might if they had enjoyed the same life chances as those in the south. A plethora of government initiatives and tens of billions of pounds of public spending have failed to reduce the glaring health inequalities, which have existed since 1066, the co-authors say.

Researchers from Manchester University and Manchester city council looked at death rates in each of the nine government office regions of England every year from 1965 to 2008. Throughout that period the north had a fifth more premature deaths – defined as those under 75 – than the south. ""Our findings point towards a severe, long-term and recently worsening structural health problem in the geography of England, which may not have received the attention it requires from government policy and which has been resistant to specific policies to reduce inequalities in health or to regenerate local communities,"" write the authors.

""Inequalities in all causes of mortality in the north-south divide were severe and persistent over the four decades from 1965 to 2008,"" they say.

The differential was more noticeable in men than women.

While the gap narrowed after the early 1980s, it rose steeply again between 2000 and 2008, and is now the widest it has been since 1965, the study found.

""There is strong evidence that the underlying causes of the divide, the 'causes of the causes', are social and economic"", said Prof Sir Michael Marmot of University College London, the UK's leading expert on health inequalities.

The Department of Health said everyone should have the same chance to lead a healthy life regardless of where they lived. ""This means tackling the wider, social causes of ill health and early death as well as addressing individual healthy lifestyles,"" said a spokeswoman.","{""British Medical Journal"": 1}","{""Michael Marmot"": 1}","{""the British Medical Journal"": 1, ""Manchester University"": 1, ""University College London"": 1, ""The Department of Health"": 1}",,"{""Manchester University"": 1, ""University College London"": 1, ""The Department of Health"": 1}"
12-11-005_telegraph,2011-02-16,North-south health divide 'at widest point in 40 years',"England's north-south health divide is at its widest in 40 years, according to a study published today. 



People in the north are 20 per cent more likely to die before the age of 75 than those in the south, found researchers at Manchester University and Manchester council. 

The health gap narrowed from the early 80s to the early 90s, they discovered, but increased ""steeply"" from 2000 to 2008 ""despite the public policy emphasis in England over this period on reducing inequalities in health"". 

Writing in the British Medical Journal, they concluded: ""This contrast indicates that the initiatives to reduce inequalities in health were insufficient to overcome the social, economic, and migration forces driving poorer health in the north than in the south."" 

In an accompanying editorial, Margaret Whitehead, professor of public health at Liverpool University, wrote: ""Since 1965, the toll of excess deaths has surpassed 1.5 million— the north is being decimated at the rate of a major city every decade."" 

Despite New Labour's efforts, she said: ""The health divide continued to grow, however, and for people under 75 it is now at its widest for 40 years. 

""Having reached this nadir in the relatively favourable economic and political climate of the 2000s, future prospects look grim."" 

However, it is only the relative health divide that has increased.

12-11-005_independent,2011-02-16,North-South health divide 'kills thousands every year',"The health divide between the North and South of the country is at its widest for 40 years and is claiming the lives of tens of thousands of people before their time, a study has found.

Every year 37,000 people – enough to fill a football stadium – die in the North earlier than their counterparts in the South. But all efforts to narrow the gap have failed. Premature deaths before the age of 75 are a fifth higher in the North, and the gap has changed little since the 1960s. It even widened between 2000 and 2008 despite government expenditure of £20bn on initiatives supposed to close it.

The divide has persisted despite large improvements in health in all regions of the country over the past 40 years. Death rates have fallen by 50 per cent in men and 40 per cent in women since 1965, with both the North and South seeing similar reductions. But the North has never caught up with the South and, in the last decade, seems to be slipping further behind.

Researchers warned yesterday that the excess toll of ill health and disability in the North was ""decimating [the region] at the rate of one major city every decade"". It is certain to get worse as the effects of the recession are felt disproportionately in the North.

Iain Buchan, professor of public health informatics at the University of Manchester, who led the study, which was published online in the British Medical Journal, said that genetic, climatic and environmental differences could ""in no way"" account for the gap.

Rather than pinning the blame on differences in lifestyle such as smoking and drinking, the key factor behind the gap was money, he said. ""The counter-intuitive fact is that the behavioural differences we can measure account for just one fifth of the gap. The difference in smoking, for example, accounts for only 14 per cent [of the northern excess deaths]. But there is a large body of evidence that shows that the amount of disposable income has a much greater effect.

""Social and economic factors are extremely reliable predictors of health. If you put more resources into an area, or take them out, its health will improve or decline. It would be unheard of for economic growth not to translate into better health.""

The health divide mirrors the income disparity between North and South, the researchers say. The ""gross value added per head"" – a measure of the state of the local economy – was 40 per cent higher in the South than the North in 2008, having risen from 25 per cent in 1989.

The cash people had to spend – their ""disposable income"" – was more than 26 per cent higher in the South, up from 21 per cent in 1995, even after allowing for the higher cost of living. Professor Buchan said the North-South divide had persisted since 1066 and reflected a London-centric nation with power and money concentrated in the South for the last 1,000 years. Benjamin Disraeli wrote that England was a tale of two countries and William Farr, the 19th-century epidemiologist and founder of medical statistics, blamed the divide on the habit of healthier people in the North migrating to better-off areas in the South, leaving their sickly peers behind.

Migration may still be a factor maintaining the divide but is unlikely to be a major one, the researchers say. Spending on the NHS is inadequate in the North, relative to the high health needs. The Commons Public Accounts Committee accused the Government of failing to address the shortage of GPs in the North in its report on health inequalities last October. Two-thirds of the areas with the highest deprivation were failing to get the money they were due for dealing with excess ill health, it said.

Professor Buchan said the failure of the huge injection of funds by the previous Labour government to close the health gap demonstrated the difficulty of overcoming the social and economic forces driving North and South apart.

""We have to target business development in the North – the South is overworked. The challenge is to have an investment strategy to make the country less London-centric. If we want better health in the North it has to go hand in hand with social and economic change.""

The North-South divide in numbers 

House prices 

The value of homes in the South rose last year, led by a 6.3 per cent increase in London. Average prices dipped in the North, with the North-east experiencing a 3.3 per cent fall, according to the Land Registry.

Income 

In 2008, average disposable household income was £19,038 in London and £16,792 in the South-east, according to the Office for National Statistics. This was against £12,543 in the North-east. London households earned more than 28 per cent over the national average in 2008.

Unemployment 

In the 12 months ending June 2010, the highest unemployment rate in Britain was in Kingston-upon-Hull, East Yorkshire, at 14 .1 per cent, followed by Blaenau Gwent in Wales at 13.8 per cent. The region with the narrowest spread of unemployment rates was the South-west, where the highest rate of unemployment was found in Torbay, at 8.8 per cent.

Shops lying vacant 

The Local Data Company described a ""large and growing"" divide. In 2010, 90 per cent of the top 25 large towns with the highest vacancies were in the Midlands or North, with 28 per cent of stores in Rotherham vacant.

The government said health inequalities were being addressed.

In 1965, those living in the north were 16% more likely to die before the age of 75 than their southern counterparts. This had risen to just over 20% by 2008.

Men were more likely to be affected. 

For men, the average geographical inequality rate over the period 1965 - 2008 was 15%, compared with 13% for women.

Lead researcher, Professor Ian Buchan, said that even when people in the North and the South were born into similar socio-economic groups, health inequalities persisted.

More resources 

He said that this was because people in the South, even if they had low incomes, had greater access to resources: ""There is an overall concentration of resource in the South, the 'built environment' is very different, there's more access to education, transport and other large scale resources.""



Public health specialist Professor Sir Michael Marmot published an update to his in-depth review on health inequalities last week. 

He said health inequalities are caused by social and economic reasons and that inequalities also existed within regions: ""There is strong evidence that the underlying causes of the divide, the 'causes of the causes' are social and economic. 

""For example, there is evidence that there are social gradients in health within every region; and that differences between neighbourhoods depend closely on their social and economic profiles. 

""While these gradients exist within every region and local area, they are wider in the North.""

Experts analysed trends for English government office regions, comparing the North with the South.

They looked at the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, East Midlands and West Midlands compared with the East of England, London, the South East and South West.

The researchers looked at the age of death across the whole population in each region they studied.



Overall, during that period, mortality in England has greatly reduced since 1965. It has reduced by about 50% for men and about 40% for women with both North and South experiencing similar reductions.

The gap between mortality rates in the North and South is now at its widest point, but it has fluctuated over the 43 years of the study. 

NHS action

From the early 1980s to the late 1990s, the North-South divide decreased significantly for both sexes. This was followed by a rise from 2000 to 2008.

Professor Iain Buchan said it was unclear why rates had fluctuated over the whole period. The rise in the rates coincided with a boom period for the economy and significant investment in northern cities.

Professor Iain Buchan said that the differences were not due to behavioural differences: ""These differences are not because those in the north are not looking after themselves... this is because of social, economic and health care resources controlled by government. For example, there are fewer GPs in deprived areas.""

The Department of Health said it was committed to reducing health inequalities: ""We are also providing a ring-fenced public health budget, weighted towards the most deprived areas, to ensure resources are spent on preventative work, with incentives to improve the health of the poorest, the fastest.""

However public health expert, Professor Alan Maryon-Davis said government cuts would worsen health inequalities: ""Health care also depends very much on social care and voluntary support in the community. I'm afraid that, with the huge cuts in local authority budgets in places like Liverpool, Manchester and other parts of the North, the divide is only likely to widen even further.""","{""British Medical Journal"": 1}","{""Ian Buchan"": 1, ""Michael Marmot"": 1, ""Iain Buchan"": 2, ""Alan Maryon-Davis"": 1}","{""the British Medical Journal"": 1, ""the University of Manchester"": 1, ""NHS"": 1, ""The Department of Health"": 1}","{""Ian Buchan"": 1, ""Iain Buchan"": 2, ""Alan Maryon-Davis"": 1}","{""the University of Manchester"": 1, ""The Department of Health"": 1}"
07-11-024_bbcnews,2011-08-01,Bear chemical brings heart hope,"A synthesised compound also found in bear bile may help the recovery of some people who have had a heart attack.

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is already used to reduce cholesterol production, and to dissolve gallstones.

Now a study by London's Imperial College has shown it could also treat potentially dangerous abnormal heart rhythms.

Bear bile is used in many traditional Chinese medicines, but critics say the way it is collected is cruel.

Electrical Signals 

The latest study shows that UDCA could prevent abnormal heart rhythm or arrhythmia, both in people who have had a heart attack, and in foetuses.

It alters the electrical properties of myofibroblast cells, which are present in the foetal heart and in patients who have suffered a heart attack. 

The study found that myofibroblasts disrupt the transmission of electrical signals that control the heart's rhythm.

""These findings are exciting"", said Dr Julia Gorelik, the study's senior author.

 ""Our results from the lab suggest that UDCA could help the heart muscle conduct electrical signals more normally.""

UDCA is already used to treat obstetric cholestasis, a condition which affects one in 200 pregnant women in the UK and is linked to a higher risk for the foetus of arrhythmia and sudden death.

The chemical lowers the levels of harmful bile acids which the disease causes, and which can pass into the infant through the placenta.

It is hoped that a clinical trial will demonstrate whether the results of this new research translate to patients with heart failure.

Commenting on the research, Peter Weisssberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""This study provides some insight into how bile acids might cause fatal rhythm disturbances in foetal hearts. 

If the same mechanism applies to adult hearts after a heart attack, this could prove to be a useful treatment to prevent serious heart rhythm disorders.""

Dr Jill Robinson, founder and CEO of Animals Asia said: ""It is welcome news that synthesised UDCA may help in the treatment of abnormal heart rhythm and other heart conditions. 

""Though UDCA can be found in bear bile, only synthetic compounds should be considered for human use, for medical, conservation and animal welfare reasons.""

05-11-008_dailymail,2011-03-09,Why you're an apple or a pear: Scientists discover protein that determines your body shape,"Scientists have identified a protein that can make people apple-shaped or pear-shaped.

The protein plays a part in how and where fat is stored in the body - around the hips or on the tummy.

The latest findings from Edinburgh University researchers shed light on how the protein works, which could help development of medicines to treat obesity.

Levels of the protein - known as 11BetaHSD1 - are higher when an unhealthy type of body fat is stored around the torso. 

This is typical of overweight people whose 'apple-shaped' bodies put them at greater risk of heart disease.

But lower levels of the protein are found when healthier fat is stored around the hips - typical of 'pear-shaped' people - and used more safely as a source of energy.

Experts know that fat packed around the organs in the abdomen is more dangerous than fat on the hips because it's 'metabolically active', releasing more of the acids that raise heart disease risk, along with factors that increase blood pressure and blood sugar.

The latest study looked at the effect of the protein in mice put on a high fat diet for four weeks.

It found those with the protein in their bodies were more likely to have unhealthy fat tissue on a high fat diet, compared with mice without the protein.

 Scientists are already looking at ways to make medicines that inhibit this protein, which is known to raise levels of hormones linked to obesity.

The research, published in the journal Diabetes was funded by the Wellcome Trust and British Heart Foundation.

Dr Nik Morton, of the University of Edinburgh's Centre for Cardiovascular Science, said 'This study opens up new avenues for research, and gives us a much better idea of why some fat in the body becomes unhealthy while other fat is safely stored for energy. 

'Inflammation in of the unhealthy fat leads to reactions that can cause harm locally to tissues and affect the whole organism, promoting diabetes.

Limiting the presence of this protein could help combat this.'

As well as being more likely to be stored around vital organs in the torso, fat with higher levels of 11BetaHSD1 is considered to be unhealthy as it is associated with an over-reaction in the immune system.

Cells normally become inflamed in order to kill off an infection, but as there is no infection in the fat tissue the inflammation instead causes damage to healthy cells.","{""Diabetes"": 1}","{""Nik Morton"": 1}","{""Edinburgh University"": 1, ""Diabetes"": 1, ""the Wellcome Trust"": 1, ""British Heart Foundation"": 1, ""the University of Edinburgh's"": 1, ""Centre for Cardiovascular Science"": 1}",,"{""Edinburgh University"": 1, ""Diabetes"": 1, ""the Wellcome Trust"": 1, ""British Heart Foundation"": 1, ""the University of Edinburgh's"": 1, ""Centre for Cardiovascular Science"": 1}"

Researchers believe apple-shaped people with large tummies have a protein known as 11BetaHSD1 which makes them store fat around vital organs.

The immune system attacks this fat, damaging the heart and pancreas and leading to diabetes.

But those who are ""pear-shaped"" are healthier because the fat is spread round their hips and thighs instead, say the Edinburgh University team, who are developing a drug to block the protein.

A round middle is one of the problems for those seeking to shed extra pounds.

Researchers at Edinburgh University say the issue may be down to a protein named 11BetaHSD1.

Levels of the substance are higher in appleshaped people who store an unhealthy type of fat around the torso.

Healthier fat, linked to lower levels of the protein, tends to gather around the hips, creating a pear-shape.

Scientists put mice on a high-fat diet and found those with the protein were more likely to have unhealthy fat tissue.

Teams are now probing ways to create medicines to inhibit the protein, which is known to raise levels of hormones linked to obesity.

As well as being more likely to be stored around vital organs, fat with higher levels of 11BetaHSD1 is associated with an over-reaction in the immune system.

Cells normally become inflamed to kill off an infection.

People with irregular heartbeats are usually given warfarin to prevent clots forming and causing strokes, but it can react with other drugs and is not ideal for frail, elderly patients.

But rivaroxaban is twice as effective at blocking fatal brain bleeds and has fewer side effects, experts from Edinburgh University and North Carolina's Duke University found.

Around 800,000 people suffer from irregular heartbeats which could make them up to six times more likely to suffer strokes, caused by a blood flow interruption to the brain.

Edinburgh University's Prof Keith Fox said: ""An alternative drug for patients with irregular heartbeats is just as effective while also easier to prescribe and take.""

05-11-024_scotsman,2011-08-11,New drug gives hope to heart patients,"Scottish researchers have found that patients with heart problems could benefit from a new drug, which reduces their risk of life-threatening complications.

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), which causes an irregular heartbeat, are currently treated with the blood-thinning drug warfarin to reduce the risk of blood clots and stroke.

Now, a new global study, led by the University of Edinburgh and the Duke University in North Carolina, has compared the effects of warfarin with the drug rivaroxaban.

The new treatment was found to be as effective as warfarin, but the risk of suffering fatal bleeding on the brain was halved in patients taking the newer treatment.

Both drugs work by reducing the clotting of the blood, but, as a result, this can increase the risk of bleeding.

Patients taking warfarin must be closely monitored to ensure they are receiving the correct dose.

Rivaroxaban does not need to be so closely monitored.

The researchers, writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, studied 14,000 patients with irregular heatbeats.

While the risk of a bleed generally in the body was the same for both treatments, rivaroxaban had other benefits for patients, including the lower risk of deadly bleeds on the brain.

Professor Keith Fox, at Edinburgh, said: ""We know that about a third of patients eligible for warfarin are not currently receiving it.

This may be because they are too frail and may not be able to manage taking the drug appropriately, with the need for blood tests and dosage levels to be monitored closely.

05-11-024_bbcnews,2011-08-10,New drug found for irregular heart beats,"Patients with irregular heart beats could benefit from a drug that is easier to administer than the current standard treatment.

The condition, which affects about 800,000 people in the UK, can lead to blood clots forming and significantly increases the risk of stroke.

The standard treatment, warfarin, was compared with the drug rivaroxaban.

Rivaroxaban was found to be as effective as warfarin in reducing the risk of stroke.

The study was led by Edinburgh University and the Duke University in North Carolina, North America.

Stroke can be four to six times higher in patients with irregular heart beats.

Both drugs work by reducing the clotting of the blood but, as a result, can increase the risk of bleeding.

The impact of warfarin can be affected by other medications and diet, so patients taking it must be closely monitored to ensure they are receiving the correct dose.

Rivaroxaban does not need to be so closely monitored, nor the dose adjusted, the study found.

'Too frail' 

Researchers studied 14,000 patients with irregular heat beats and at risk of stroke, a condition known as atrial fibrillation, who were given either warfarin or rivaroxaban.

The study also found the incidence of bleeding was similar for both drugs.

The risk of fatal bleeding on the brain was halved (from five per 1,000 to approximately two per 1,000) among patients taking rivaroxaban.

Atrial fibrillation can affect adults of any age, but is more common as people get older, affecting about 10% of over-65s.

05-11-024_reuters,2011-08-10,Bayer anti-clot drug gets cautious journal welcome,"Wed Aug 10, 2011 10:00pm BST 

An anti-clotting pill from Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and Johnson & Johnson offers a new way of preventing stroke although further studies will be needed to refine treatment options, according to a review in a top medical journal. 

Wednesday's editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) will be read closely by doctors and industry analysts, who have been grappling with results from a difficult-to-interpret clinical trial of Xarelto. 

Gregory Zoppo of the University of Washington, and Misha Eliasziw of the University of Calgary, said the mix of statistical analyses used to assess the once-daily drug had ""muddied the waters"" over its benefits. 

Xarelto, known generically as rivaroxaban, was hailed last November as being 21 percent better at preventing stroke in patients with a form of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation (AF) than the standard treatment, warfarin. 

But this conclusion was based on an analysis that excluded certain patients. When all those who entered the trial were evaluated, no superiority was established for Xarelto. 

""I think we can say safely that rivaroxaban is not inferior to warfarin.

I don't think we can say it is superior,"" Zoppo said in a telephone interview.

""Non-inferiority is not a bad thing."" 

The editorial also highlighted the fact warfarin, which requires patients to have regular blood tests to ensure correct dosing, was not used as effectively as it might have been in the study. 

And the authors said an ""important concern"" was that new anticoagulants such as Xarelto did not have antidotes to rapidly reverse their anti-coagulation effects in the event of serious bleeding.

Patients on warfarin can be given vitamin K. 

The full results of the so-called ROCKET-AF study were published in the NEJM alongside the editorial. 

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Xarelto for preventing blood clots after knee and hip surgery, and it is expected to decide whether to approve it in the much larger stroke-prevention market later this year. 

A similar drug called Pradaxa, or dabigatran, from Boehringer Ingelheim is on the market and several others are under development, including apixaban from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer . 

All aim to replace warfarin, a problematic drug, in the lucrative market for millions of mainly elderly patients with AF.

Zoppo said their arrival was a notable advance. 

""What's really exciting about rivaroxaban and dabigatran is now we have some alternatives to warfarin that are relatively easy to take and their control seems to be pretty straightforward,"" he said. 

""Is everybody going to switch from warfarin?

I think the answer is 'No'.

Patients who are managed very well on warfarin should stay on it."" 

He said there was scope for further trials looking at the relative merits of existing drugs and other, even newer ones still in earlier stages of development.","{""top medical journal"": 1, ""the New England Journal of Medicine"": 1, ""NEJM"": 1}","{""Gregory Zoppo"": 1, ""Misha Eliasziw"": 1, ""Xarelto"": 2, ""Zoppo"": 2}","{""Bayer (BAYGn.DE)"": 1, ""Johnson & Johnson"": 1, ""the New England Journal of Medicine"": 1, ""NEJM"": 2, ""Xarelto"": 2, ""the University of Washington"": 1, ""the University of Calgary"": 1, ""ROCKET-AF"": 1, ""The U.S. Food and Drug Administration"": 1, ""Boehringer Ingelheim"": 1, ""Bristol-Myers Squibb"": 1, ""Pfizer"": 1, ""AF"": 1}","{""Gregory Zoppo"": 1, ""Misha Eliasziw"": 1, ""Zoppo"": 1}","{""Bayer (BAYGn.DE)"": 1, ""Johnson & Johnson"": 1, ""the New England Journal of Medicine"": 1, ""NEJM"": 1, ""Xarelto"": 2, ""the University of Washington"": 1, ""the University of Calgary"": 1, ""The U.S. Food and Drug Administration"": 1, ""Boehringer Ingelheim"": 1, ""Bristol-Myers Squibb"": 1, ""Pfizer"": 1}"
06-11-015_bbcnews,2011-06-29,Obesity 'is higher among non-smoking women',"Non-smoking woman are more likely to be obese and die of associated illnesses than those who smoke, according to research.

About 8,000 women were recruited to the Renfrew and Paisley study from 1972 to 1976. Of these, 40% had never smoked.

The authors, led by Dr Laurence Gruer from NHS Health Scotland, found 60% of non-smokers were overweight or obese compared with 40% of those who smoked.

The study claimed extra weight acted as a major contributor to premature death.

However, experts stressed that smoking was a ""much stronger"" risk factor than obesity.

The study of women aged 45 to 64, published in the British Medical Journal, said the highest rate of obesity among non-smokers was found in low income groups.

Almost 70% of women in this category were overweight or obese, according to the research.

Dr Gruer said: ""You can certainly assume that if you are obese, you are more likely to die of things like diabetes, heart attacks and strokes.""

Researchers also suggested declining numbers of female smokers over the past few decades may have had a direct impact on obesity levels - with fewer people using cigarettes in an attempt to suppress their appetites.

The study also found that non-smokers from a lower occupational group were no more likely to die early if they lived a healthy lifestyle.

Dr Gruer said: ""If you never smoke and you keep your weight within the reasonable limit then even if you earn below average income and live in a more disadvantaged area, you can still expect to live a long and healthy life.

""You are not doomed to die early just because you happen not to have a high income or good job or live in a leafy suburb.

""It goes against the idea that if you live in a poor neighbourhood or came from a working class background, then your health will be worse, regardless.""

03-11-029_reuters,2011-09-15,Serotonin levels affect brain's response to anger: study,"(Reuters) - Fluctuating levels of the brain chemical serotonin, often brought on when someone hasn't eaten or is stressed, affect brain regions that enable people to regulate anger, scientists said Thursday.

In a study using healthy volunteers, researchers from Britain's Cambridge University found that when serotonin levels are low, it may be more difficult for the brain to control emotional responses to anger.

Although reduced serotonin levels have previously been linked to aggression, this is the first study to show how this chemical helps regulate behavior in the brain as well as why some individuals may be more prone to aggression.

The researchers behind the work, which was published in the journal Biological Psychiatry, hope their findings could help in the search for new treatments for psychiatric disorders where violence and aggression are common symptoms.

For the study, healthy volunteers' serotonin levels were altered by manipulating their diet.

On the serotonin depletion day, they were given a mixture of amino acids that lacked tryptophan, the building block for serotonin. 

On the placebo day, they were given the same mixture but with a normal amount of tryptophan.

The researchers then scanned the volunteers' brains using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as they viewed faces with angry, sad, and neutral expressions. 

They were able to measure how different brain regions reacted and communicated with one another when the volunteers saw angry faces, as opposed to sad or neutral faces.

The results showed that low brain serotonin made communications between specific brain regions of the emotional limbic system of the brain -- a structure called the amygdala -- and the frontal lobes weaker compared to when serotonin levels are normal.

Using a personality questionnaire, the researchers also analysed which of the volunteers had a natural tendency to behave aggressively. 

In these people, the communications between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex was even weaker following serotonin depletion.

""Although these results came from healthy volunteers, they are also relevant for a broad range of psychiatric disorders,"" said Luca Passamonti, who worked on the research with colleagues at the Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit of the Medical Research Council in Cambridge.

For example, Passamonti said, patients with an condition known as intermittent explosive disorder (IED) typically can have intense, uncontrollable outbursts of violence which may be triggered by cues such as a facial expression of anger.

02-11-049_dailymail,2011-12-14,Scientists discover 'master switch' that stops cancer cells from growing,"British scientists have discovered a new way to stop cancer in its tracks by manipulating a master switch responsible for cell growth. 

The findings, published in the journal Cancer Cell, reveal how cancer cells grow faster by producing their own blood vessels.

Cancer cells gain the nutrients they need by producing proteins that make blood vessels grow, helping deliver oxygen and sugars to the tumour.

These proteins are formed by a process of different parts of genes slotting together.

Scientists from the University of the West of England (UWE) and Bristol University studied tissues removed from kidney cancer patients at Southmead Hospital.

They discovered that mutations in a specific cancer gene controlled the balance of this process, called splicing, and in turn managed to find a way of using drugs to switch it off. 

This stopped the growth of cancers.

Dr Michael Ladomery, from UWE, cautioned that halting the process of growing cancer cells had only been tried in models so far.

He said: 'It is important to stress that this is basic research. 

This could give encouragement that splicing can have a profound effect on tumour growth and encourages others to go down this particular path.'

Dr Ladomery said their research showed a similar process happened in eye disease and the discovery in Bristol could eventually lead to better treatments in that field too.

He said: 'The research clearly demonstrates that it may be possible to block tumour growth by targeting and manipulating alternative splicing in patients, adding to the increasingly wide armoury of potential anti-cancer therapies.'

Professor Steve Harper, consultant nephrologist and part of the research team, said:  'This shows how important it is for patients, doctors and scientists to come together in an excellent environment like Bristol to make these groundbreaking discoveries.'

03-11-005_dailymail,2011-01-14,Scientists create GM 'superchicken' that doesn’t spread bird flu,"A genetically modified 'superchicken' that doesn't spread deadly bird flu has been developed by scientists. 

The bird is intended to prevent the outbreaks of avian influenza which lead to millions of birds being culled. 

It could also stop new strains of flu mutating in domestic fowl and spreading to people, leading to killer worldwide pandemics. 

The British team behind the GM chicken say it is 'inconceivable' that its meat or eggs could be harmful. 

However, it will need rigorous safety checks before it could go into the food chain, they said. 

But anti GM campaigners warned that genetic engineering was not the answer to stopping bird flu - and said the public would never accept GM eggs and meat. 

Avian flu is a serious threat to farmers and people. Although it does not easily infect humans, when it does it can be deadly. 

The latest, most virulent strain - called H5N1 - has killed more than 300 people since 2003 in 15 countries and led to the deaths of millions of birds. 

In 2007 around 260,000 turkeys were culled in East Anglia after outbreaks of H5N1.  

Doctors fear it could mutate in flocks of chickens into a new strain that is transmissible from person to person,  fuelling a pandemic that kills millions of people. 

The GM chicken was created by a team at Cambridge University and Edinburgh University and reported today in the journal Science. 

Dr Laurence Tiley, from Cambridge, said: 'Preventing virus transmission in chickens should reduce the economic impact of the disease and reduce the risk posed to people exposed to the infected birds.' 

The chickens carry an extra gene that stops the flu virus replicating in their bodies.

 The gene - which was added to embryo chicks while they were in the egg - produces 'decoy' loops of RNA,  the chemical cousin of DN, in cells throughout their bodies. 

The decoy RNA interferes with the machinery that viruses use to make copies of themselves inside cells and spread throughout the body. 

So although GM chickens fall  ill and die from flu - they cannot pass it onto other birds or people. 

In tests at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, Surrey, infecte GM chickens fell sick but did not transmit the flu virus to normal birds kept in the same pen. 

 The gene is expected to work against all strains of bird flu, and the virus cannot easily evolve to escape its effects. 

Because the new gene is dominant, chicks bred from a pair of GM birds will also be unable to transmit bird flu. 

The trait will be passed down to future generations. 

Dr Tiley said there was 'no observable difference' between the GM birds and their non-GM relatives he said. 

'The nature of the decoy molecule means it is pretty well inconceivable that could have any detrimental effect on somebody that ate it because RNA is an unstable molecule that is easily broken down by the gut,' he said.

  'There is no reason to suggest that these chickens would be unsafe in any way.' 

GM birds would need thorough safety tests and the approval of food agencies in America and Europe before they could enter the food chain. 

Co-author Prof Helen Sang, from the Roslin Institute, Edinburgh, said: 'Countries like China are interested in possibly of using GM to protect their poultry stocks and it will inevitably be more expensive because you will have to use products of breeding companies to stock your producers,' she said.  

However, costs would come down over time, she added.  

The researchers are now working on chickens that are completely immune to bird flu. 

They believe the technique could be used to protect against the spread of disease in other animals such as turkeys, geese and pigs. 

But Pete Riley from GM Freeze said: 'These are global industries with thousands of broiler and battery units around the world and it improbable that the GM chickens will be bred fast enough to keep pace with the mutations that are occurring in avian flu virus all the time around in the northern and southern hemisphere. 

'In intensive units the environment is quite different to the lab and so far this has not been part of the research. 

 In addition, many poorer producers may find the additional cost of the GM birds too high and stick with conventionally bred birds. 

'Genetic diversity in chickens, not genetic modification of a single breed, is important in reducing the spread of infections, as it is with all farm animals'.","{""Science"": 1}","{""Laurence Tiley"": 1, ""Tiley"": 1, ""Helen Sang"": 1, ""Pete Riley"": 1, ""Freeze"": 1}","{""GM"": 13, ""Cambridge University"": 1, ""Edinburgh University"": 1, ""the Veterinary Laboratories Agency"": 1, ""the Roslin Institute"": 1}","{""Helen Sang"": 1, ""Pete Riley"": 1, ""Freeze"": 1}","{""GM"": 4, ""Cambridge University"": 1, ""Edinburgh University"": 1, ""the Veterinary Laboratories Agency"": 1, ""the Roslin Institute"": 1}"
03-11-005_guardian,2011-01-13,GM chickens created that could prevent the spread of bird flu,"Researchers produce genetically modified (GM) chickens that may cut the risk of new bird flu strains transferring to humans

Scientists have produced genetically modified chickens that appear to prevent the spread of avian influenza.  

Though the chickens can themselves become infected with flu viruses such as H5N1, say the researchers, they cannot pass on the virus to any other birds with which they come into contact.

The technique, if adopted commercially, could provide a new strategy to slow or prevent outbreaks of bird flu within poultry flocks, which would protect the health of chickens and also reduce the chances of viruses transferring to humans. 

Many flu viruses that infect humans, including the H1N1 strain behind the swine flu pandemic that swept across the world in 2009 and caused 6,000 deaths, start in domestic birds before transferring to mammals such as horses and pigs, and then ending up in humans.

""Chickens … can enable new strains of flu to be transmitted to humans,"" said Laurence Tiley, a molecular virologist at the University of Cambridge's department of veterinary medicine, who led the work. 

""Preventing virus transmission in chickens should reduce the economic impact of the disease and reduce the risk posed to people exposed to the infected birds.""

The work is a proof-of-principle project and it would take several years of safety tests before any transgenic chickens would be allowed to enter the food chain.

Though there are no transgenic animals currently approved for human consumption, they might not be far away. 

Last year, the US Food and Drug Administration proposed allowing the sale of the AquAdvantage salmon – a modified North Atlantic salmon created by AquaBounty Technologies in Boston, Massachusetts. 

The company says the salmon grows at twice the speed of similar fish.

In the new research on chickens – described in the latest edition of Science – Tiley's team introduced a gene into chicken embryos that produces a small ""decoy"" molecule in the birds' cells. 

The decoy molecule mimics part of the molecular control mechanism of the bird flu virus, in this case H5N1. 

The virus incorporates the decoy instead of its own genetic material and becomes unable to replicate properly in the transgenic chicken's cells.

In their experiment, the scientists infected 10 genetically modified birds and 10 related, but non-GM birds with the avian H5N1 virus. 

Each infected group was then split into two sub-groups of five, and each sub-group was exposed to a new group of either 12 GM or 12 non-GM birds. 

The next step was to keep all groups for about 12 days and record the health status of all the birds.

All the non-GM birds died within five days of infection and the birds that came into contact with them also died a few days later, exactly as expected. 

The GM birds infected with H5N1 also died after a few days but, crucially, none of the birds they came into contact with – transgenic or not – became infected.

""Our genetic modification doesn't stop the birds getting flu if you infect them directly, but once they've got it, they don't transmit it,"" said Helen Sang of the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh, who also worked on the project.

How the decoy prevents the spread of the virus is still uncertain. Tiley believes the virus that is produced and shed by the cells of the transgenic birds has a defect that prevents it from efficiently infecting other birds.

The genetic decoy would work against all strains of avian influenza, said Tiley, and the virus would be unlikely to evolve a way to escape its effects. 

""This is quite different from conventional flu vaccines, which need to be updated in the face of virus evolution as they tend only to protect against closely matching strains of virus and do not always prevent spread within a flock.""

Whether or not transgenic chickens should be used commercially was a question for regulators, companies and consumers, the scientists said.

 ""The genetic modification we describe is a significant first step along the path to developing chickens that are completely resistant to avian flu,"" said Tiley.

 ""These particular birds are only intended for research purposes, not for consumption.""

Even if they were approved for use, the technology would not be required everywhere. 

""The expectation is that you would introduce it in countries where there is endemic avian influenza,"" said Sang.

 ""At the moment, in Europe it's not endemic so you wouldn't expect to use it here.""

She added: ""If you're thinking longer-term application of the technology, we want to facilitate public debate about using genetic modification for this purpose in commercial production birds.""","{""Science"": 1}","{""Laurence Tiley"": 1, ""Helen Sang"": 1, ""Tiley"": 3, ""Sang"": 1}","{""the University of Cambridge's"": 1, ""the US Food and Drug Administration"": 1, ""AquaBounty Technologies"": 1, ""Science \u2013 Tiley's"": 1, ""GM"": 2, ""the Roslin Institute"": 1, ""the University of Edinburgh"": 1}","{""Laurence Tiley"": 1, ""Tiley"": 2, ""Helen Sang"": 1, ""Sang"": 1}","{""the University of Cambridge's"": 1, ""the US Food and Drug Administration"": 1, ""AquaBounty Technologies"": 1, ""Science \u2013 Tiley's"": 1, ""the Roslin Institute"": 1, ""the University of Edinburgh"": 1}"
03-11-005_telegraph,2011-01-14,Chickens genetically modified to stop bird flu,"Chickens have been genetically modified to prevent them spreading potentially deadly bird flu. 

The British research may lead to ways of halting bird flu outbreaks within poultry stocks. 

As well as protecting the health of poultry, it could reduce the risk of a killer pandemic among humans. 

Bird, or avian, flu does not easily infect humans but when it does the effects can be serious - one strain, H5N1, has caused around 300 deaths since the mid-1990s and kills almost 80% of all those it infects. 

Experts fear a mutated version of the virus that transmits easily from person to person could claim millions of victims around the world. 

Dr Laurence Tiley, from Cambridge University, one of the scientists who carried out the new research, said: ""Chickens are potential bridging hosts that can enable new strains of flu to be transmitted to humans. 

Preventing virus transmission in chickens should reduce the economic impact of the disease and reduce the risk posed to people exposed to the infected birds.",,"{""Laurence Tiley"": 1}","{""Cambridge University"": 1}","{""Laurence Tiley"": 1}","{""Cambridge University"": 1}"
03-11-005_independent,2011-01-14,GM lab creates chicken that cannot spread bird flu,"Scientists have developed a way of curbing the spread of avian flu with the help of genetically modified chickens that do not spread the virus.

The chickens have an extra piece of DNA inserted into their genomes which produces a ""decoy"" molecule that blocks the replication of the influenza virus and prevents transmission to the rest of the flock.

Researchers believe the breakthrough could eventually lead to the creation of GM poultry, pigs and other livestock that are fully resistant to a range of infectious diseases. 

They also said that the development could help to lower the risk of transmitting dangerous animal viruses to humans.

While consumers in Britain have been resistant to plant-based products containing GM ingredients, the scientists behind the GM chicken believe that the proposal to develop disease-resistant varieties might become acceptable due to concerns about animal welfare and the transmission of infections to humans. 

Laurence Tiley of Cambridge University, who was a key member of the research team, said: ""We believe the attitude of the UK public to GM food depends on the nature and purpose of the genetic modification.

""Disease resistance is clearly a beneficial characteristic for animal welfare and public health.""

The GM chicken was created by adding a synthetic fragment of DNA to their chromosomes, which causes the chickens to manufacture small lengths of RNA, the genetic molecule used by influenza viruses.

These particular pieces of RNA act as decoys by locking on to the enzyme used by flu viruses to make copies of themselves.

""The decoy mimics an essential part of the flu virus genome that is identical for all strains of influenza A.

""We expect the decoy to work against all strains of avian flu and that the virus will find it difficult to evolve to escape the effects of the decoy. 

If you've got genetically modified chickens that are resistant to the avian flu virus then you don't in theory have to bother with vaccination anymore,"" he added. 

When scientists carried out tests on the GM chickens they found that although the birds were still vulnerable to being infected with avian flu and that they became sick with flu, but they did not appear to transmit the virus to other members of their flock, even if these birds were normal, non-GM varieties.

Helen Sang of the Roslin Institute at Edinburgh University, another leading member of the team that carried out the study, published in the journal Science, said that the results achieved so far are ""very encouraging"".","{""Science"": 1}","{""Laurence Tiley"": 1, ""Helen Sang"": 1}","{""GM"": 6, ""Cambridge University"": 1, ""the Roslin Institute"": 1, ""Edinburgh University"": 1}","{""Laurence Tiley"": 1, ""Helen Sang"": 1}","{""GM"": 1, ""Cambridge University"": 1, ""the Roslin Institute"": 1, ""Edinburgh University"": 1}"
03-11-005_bbcnews,2011-01-13,World's first flu-resistant GM chickens 'created',"UK scientists have created the world's first genetically modified chickens that do not spread bird flu. 

Writing in Science journal, the team says their work demonstrates it is possible to create a variety of GM farm animals resistant to viral diseases. 

The research team inserted an artificial gene into chickens; this introduces a tiny part of the bird flu virus into chicken cells.

These birds become infected but render the virus harmless to other poultry.

The team believes that the genetic modification they have introduced is harmless to the chickens and to people who might eat the birds. 

Professor Helen Sang of Edinburgh University told BBC News that genetic modification is potentially a much better way of protecting against diseases than vaccination because the GM technique works even if the virus mutates.

""It will protect a whole flock from avian influenza infection. 

This is really exciting because bird flu is a real challenge to poultry production and if it were introduced to poultry breeding it would protect our large scale production flocks from avian inlfuenza,"" said Professor Sang.

Broad protection 

The researchers say that, in principle, the technique could be used to protect any farm animal from any disease. The eventual aim is to develop animals that are completely resistant to viral diseases.

Genetic modification could be an alternative to vaccination, scientists say 

According to co-author Dr Laurence Tiley, from the University of Cambridge, UK: ""Agricultural selective breeding has made huge improvements on productivity of many livestock - but it's reaching the point where it's now limited. 

""And the GM technologies allow you to introduce novel genes that don't exist in nature but are based on our detailed knowledge of the molecular biology of viruses. 

We can specifically target these viruses to prevent them from replicating.""

The researchers say they think the technology has the potential to boost food production and reduce costs.

""There's going to be a real problem in feeding the world as the population increases,"" says Professor Sang. 

""As the demand for animal products increases and it's going to get increasingly expensive and we are looking at different ways to tackle that problem.""

GM techniques could also have benefits for human health, according to Professor Sang.

 If fewer animals are carrying viruses there is a lower chance of them mutating into a form that would be deadly to humans and so create a pandemic.

Cautious welcome 

But the news received a cautious welcome from the poultry industry. Peter Bradnock of The British Poultry Council said more research was needed to assess the long term impact on farm animals before food producers would even consider using the technology. 

Even then, companies would have to assess the likely reaction from consumers: ""We have to have a big debate as to whether society wants to have GM animals even for this very good potential benefit,"" he told BBC News.

And Tim Elsdale, who is an organic farmer in East Sussex, said it was better to adopt good farming practices to avoid animals getting diseases in the first place than to create GM farm animals.

""We don't suffer much from animal diseases on this farm,"" he said. 

""Organic methods of husbandry doesn't encourage disease if the animals are well spaced enough. 

They live in a natural environment and they eat normal food then a lot of diseases that are prevalent on conventional farming would not be apparent to us"".

If the food and farming industry did want to use GM technology in this way in the UK, they would need to seek prior approval from the Food Standards Agency (FSA). 

The FSA would conduct a full detailed safety evaluation before any of this GM produce could enter the market. 

In addition to that, produce would need to be labelled so that consumers would be able to make a choice about the food they eat. 

If there were an application, the authorisation process could be carried out in a matter of months.

The FSA's Chief Scientist, Dr Andrew Wadge said it would be interesting to see if the debate over GM animals would go the same way as the debate over GM crops:

""I do think it's interesting that so far with GM technology it's not really a benefit for consumers and wouldn't it be interesting if we had produce that did offer a benefit? 

""For example, food safety for us is about a bacteria found in chickens called Campylobacter which makes 500,000 people ill each year. 

""If we could develop a GM chicken that is resistant to Campylobacter it would be very interesting indeed to see how consumers saw that technology and whether it was a technology they would be willing to embrace"".","{""Science"": 1}","{""Helen Sang"": 1, ""Sang"": 3, ""Laurence Tiley"": 1, ""Peter Bradnock"": 1, ""Tim Elsdale"": 1, ""Andrew Wadge"": 1}","{""GM"": 12, ""Edinburgh University"": 1, ""BBC"": 1, ""the University of Cambridge"": 1, ""The British Poultry Council"": 1, ""BBC News"": 1, ""the Food Standards Agency"": 1, ""FSA"": 3}","{""Sang"": 3, ""Laurence Tiley"": 1, ""Tim Elsdale"": 1, ""Andrew Wadge"": 1}","{""GM"": 5, ""Edinburgh University"": 1, ""BBC"": 1, ""BBC News"": 1, ""the University of Cambridge"": 1, ""The British Poultry Council"": 1, ""the Food Standards Agency"": 1, ""FSA"": 3}"
03-11-005_reuters,2011-01-13,Scientists make chickens that don't spread bird flu,"LONDON (Reuters) - British scientists have developed genetically modified (GM) chickens that cannot transmit bird flu infections -- a step that in future could reduce the risk of avian flu spreading and causing deadly epidemics in humans.

Scientists from Cambridge and Edinburgh universities said that while the transgenic chickens still got sick and died when they were exposed to H5N1 bird flu, they didn't transmit the virus to other chickens they came into contact with.

""Preventing virus transmission in chickens should reduce the economic impact of the disease and reduce the risk posed to people,"" said Laurence Tiley, of Cambridge's department of veterinary medicine, one of the lead researchers on the study.

H5N1 bird flu has been circulating in Asia and the Middle East, with occasional outbreaks in Europe, since 2003 and has killed or forced the destruction of hundreds of millions of birds, according to the world animal health organization OIE.

It rarely infects people but when it does it is deadly: the World Health Organization has documented 516 cases in people since 2003 and the virus has killed 306 of them.

Experts say the danger is that the virus will evolve into a form that people can easily catch and pass to one another, causing the transmission rate to soar and producing a pandemic in which millions of people could die.

ECONOMIC AND FOOD SECURITY THREAT

In Southeast Asia, China and parts of Africa, bird flu is already a major economic and food security issue, and also poses a constant threat of being transmitted to humans.

South Korea, already battling an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, said this week it was raising its bird flu alert level after detecting H5N1 bird flu at poultry farms.

Helen Sang from the Roslin Institute at Edinburgh University, who worked with Tiley, told a joint briefing the GM chickens could offer a way to improve economic and food security in parts of the world where bird flu is a major threat, but said using them would probably add slightly to farming costs.

""Countries like China are interested in the possibility of genetic modification to protect their poultry stocks and people,"" she said. ""It will inevitably be more expensive because you'd have to use the products of breeding companies to stock the producers."" At the same time, the need for vaccination and losses from whole flocks being infected should be reduced.

While large poultry producers could benefit from this early type of transgenic bird, smaller ""backyard"" farmers would need to wait until scientists create birds that can be bred on small farms. ""That would be a means of ensuring that the birds these small farmers bred themselves still carried the protective transgene,"" Tiley said.

To breed their GM chickens, the researchers introduced a new gene into them that manufactures a small ""decoy"" molecule that mimics an important control element of the bird flu virus.

The replication machinery of the virus is tricked into recognizing the decoy molecule instead of the viral genes and this interferes with the virus' replication cycle.

After producing the modified chickens, they infected 10 of them and 10 normal chickens with H5N1 bird flu. Like the normal chickens, the transgenic birds became sick with the virus, but they did not transmit the infection on to other chickens kept in the same pen with them -- even if those chickens were normal, non-transgenic birds. The study was published in Science.

The researchers said they now plan to work on trying to make chickens that are fully resistant to bird flu rather than just blocking bird-to-bird transmission.","{""Science"": 1}","{""Laurence Tiley"": 1, ""Helen Sang"": 1, ""Tiley"": 2}","{""Reuters"": 1, ""OIE"": 1, ""the World Health Organization"": 1, ""the Roslin Institute"": 1, ""Edinburgh University"": 1, ""GM"": 2}","{""Laurence Tiley"": 1, ""Tiley"": 2, ""Helen Sang"": 1}","{""OIE"": 1, ""the Roslin Institute"": 1, ""Edinburgh University"": 1, ""GM"": 1}"

SPEEDING UP BLOOD FLOW, RESEARCHERS FIND

IT'S no joke being stuck in a hospital bed.

But it seems that the old adage is true Ð laughter really is the best medicine.

It is likely to put you on the road to recovery more quickly than any hi-tech treatment. simply by increasing your circulation, researchers have found.

A five-year study of patients with leg ulcers has established that a hearty chuckle stimulates the diaphragm which, in turn, plays a vital part in moving blood around the body,

It actually speeds recovery from leg ulcers, said the report by the University of Leeds' School of Healthcare.

In contrast, expensive ultrasound therapy does little to help, contrary to what the researchers had expected to find. Traditional nursing care is also effective and this human contact is likely to lead to jokes and banter which is where the laughter therapy comes in.

The research, published by the British Medical Journal, said: 'Forget technology. The best prescription for patients with venous leg ulcers is good quality nursing care and the occasional belly laugh!'

About 500,000 people suffer from recurrent leg ulcers in the UK. They are common in those with varicose veins or mobility problems and the condition is becoming more common with increased obesity. The older and larger ulcers become, the harder they are to get rid of, hence the search for solutions that could speed the healing process. A number of small studies had suggested that ultrasound could be the answer.

Professor Andrea Nelson, who led the study, said: 'The key to care with this group of patients is to stimulate blood flow back up the legs to the heart. The best way to do that is with compression bandages and support stockings not ""magic wands"" Ð coupled with advice on diet and exercise.

'Believe it or not, having a really hearty chuckle can help too. This is because laughing gets the diaphragm moving and this plays a vital part in moving blood around the body.'

Complicated leg ulcers can take six months or more to heal. Ultrasound therapy did not speed this up Ð but did add an average of £200 per patient to their care bill.

12-11-012_dailymail,2011-05-04,HIV drug could prevent 'cervical cancer by killing off virus that causes disease',"Hope for patients as cervical tumours caused by sexually transmitted HPV soar as new cases of HIV fall



Threat: The human papilloma virus, which causes cervical cancer, can be eliminated by drugs that tackle HIV

A simple treatment using a widely prescribed HIV drug could prevent cervical cancer, research suggests.

It raises new hope for victims as the number of cervical cancers caused by the sexual transmission of human papilloma virus (HPV) soar - while the number of new cases of HIV are falling across the globe.

HPV is now the most common sexually transmitted infection and the most common cause of cervical cancer.

It also triggers significant numbers of mouth and throat cancers in both men and women after it is transmitted through oral sex.

Earlier research suggests that one in six British women have HPV. 

Around 3,000 women in the UK each year contract cervical cancer and it accounts for more than 900 deaths.

The drug lopinavir kills cells infected by the HPV while leaving healthy cells relatively unharmed, scientists have found.

Researchers from the University of Manchester, working with colleagues in Canada, made the discovery after carrying out laboratory tests on cell cultures.

Dr Ian Hampson, from the university's school of cancer and enabling sciences, said: ‘This is a very significant finding as these cells are not cancer cells but are the closest thing to being like the cells found in a pre-cancerous HPV infection of the cervix.

‘In addition we were also able to show that lopinavir kills these HPV-infected cells by re-activating a well-known antiviral system that is suppressed by HPV.’

To be effective as a treatment, the drug would have to be administered in doses 10 to 15 times that taken by HIV patients. 

This would mean applying it as a cream or pessary, rather than swallowing a tablet, said Dr Hampson.

The research is published today in the journal Antiviral Therapy.

Co-author Dr Lynne Hampson said: ‘These results are very exciting since they show that the drug not only preferentially kills HPV-infected non-cancerous cells by re-activating known antiviral defence systems, it is also much less toxic to normal non-HPV infected cells.



Pain: The cervical cancer vaccination is expensive and the HIV drug lopinavir is a far cheaper alternative for use in developing countries 

‘Lopinavir is obviously safe for people to take as tablets or liquid but our latest findings provide very strong evidence to support a clinical trial using topical application of this drug to treat HPV infections of the cervix.’

Although HPV vaccines are already in use, they suffer from a number of drawbacks, the scientists pointed out.

Vaccines are not effective in women already infected with the virus, and they do not protect against all HPV strains.

In addition they are prohibitively expensive, limiting their use in poorer countries.

HPV-related cervical cancer is one of the most common women's cancers in developing countries, accounting for around 290,000 deaths per year.

A cheap, self-administered treatment which could eliminate early-stage HPV infections would have distinct advantages, say the researchers.","{""Antiviral Therapy"": 1}","{""Ian Hampson"": 1, ""Hampson"": 1, ""Lynne Hampson"": 1}","{""the University of Manchester"": 1, ""Antiviral Therapy"": 1}","{""Hampson"": 2, ""Lynne Hampson"": 1}","{""the University of Manchester"": 1, ""Antiviral Therapy"": 1}"

The drug lopinavir could be used as a cream to combat the human papilloma virus (HPV).

It would be better than a vaccine but needs five years of trials first.

Dr Ian Hampson, of the University of Manchester’s School of Medicine, said: “We have now found lopinavir selectively kills HPV-infected, non-cancerous cells, while leaving healthy cells relatively unaffected.”

The HPV virus makes the cervix cells abnormal and they can become cancerous if not treated.

Women have regular smear tests to pick up signs of abnormal or pre-cancerous cells but almost 3,000 in the UK are diagnosed with cervical cancer every year.

Dr Lynne Hampson, co-author of the study published in the journal Antiviral Therapy and carried out by PhD student Gavin Batman, added: “These results are very exciting.”

Dr Ian Hampson, who led the  research, said: ‘I was speechless when I saw the results. I think this drug or others like it undoubtedly has a future as a treatment that can prevent cervical cancer.’ 

HPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which affects 3,000 women in Britain each year and  accounts for more than 900 deaths. It also triggers mouth and throat cancers in women and men. 

Lopinavir belongs to a class of drugs called protease inhibitors which block an enzyme needed by viruses such as HIV and HPV to replicate. 

The drug kills HPV-infected cells by re-activating an antiviral system that is suppressed by HPV. Lopinavir may also fight malignant cells as well, say the scientists from the University of Manchester, who worked with colleagues in Canada. 

Although HPV vaccines are already in use they do not protect against all HPV strains and are prohibitively  expensive, limiting their use in poorer countries. However, no vaccine can cure those who already have HPV. 

HPV-related cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers that  affects women living in developing countries, accounting for 290,000 deaths a year. 

A cheap, self-administered treatment which could eliminate early-stage HPV infections would have distinct advantages, say the researchers.",,"{""Ian Hampson"": 1}","{""Lopinavir"": 1, ""the University of Manchester"": 1}","{""Ian Hampson"": 1}","{""Lopinavir"": 1, ""the University of Manchester"": 1}"

Researchers have discovered that there is a direct correlation between the size of a mammal's brain and the amount of time they suckle.

The scientists were not sure whether it was the energy that milk supplied or the nutrients that made the difference.

""It supports the theory that breast-feeding and brain development are associated with each other,"" said study author Prof Robert Barton, of Durham University. 

""What we don't know at the moment is if there is anything in mother's milk that helps the brain to grow.

""At the moment we cannot say for sure that formula milk is not an adequate replacement.""

His team studied 128 mammal species, including humans.

A pioneering study has managed to decode the patterns of electrical activity created in the brain related to vision.

While brainwaves have been easily measured for decades using an electroencephalography (EEG) test, knowing exactly what information is contained within them has remained mystery.

Now neuroscientists at Glasgow University have identified which part of the mind becomes active when trying to decipher emotions while looking at faces.

Study leader Professor Philippe Schyns said the process was like unlocking a ""scrambled television channel"".

The study involved presenting six volunteers with images of people's faces, displaying emotions such as happiness, fear and surprise.

Parts of the images were randomly covered so that, for example, only the eyes or mouth were visible.

The participants were then asked to identify the emotion being displayed while their brainwaves were measured.

Researchers found 'beta' waves of a particular frequency carried information about the eyes, while 'theta' waves of another frequency related to the mouth.

Glasgow University researchers asked volunteers to identify different emotions on images of human faces.

They then measured the volunteers' resulting brainwaves using a technique called electroencephalography (EEG).

Once researchers compared the answers to the brainwaves recorded, they were able to decode the type of information the brainwaves held relating to vision.

The research was carried out by the university's institute of neuroscience and psychology.

Six volunteers were presented with images of people's faces, displaying different emotions such as happiness, fear and surprise. 

Facial information 

On different experimental trials, parts of the images were randomly covered so that, for example, only the eyes or mouth were visible.

The volunteers were then asked to identify the emotion being displayed.

The participants' brainwaves were measured using EEG which allowed the researchers to identify which parts of the brain were active when looking at different parts of the face.

Brainwaves vary widely in frequency, amplitude and phase. 

In this study, the researchers found that 'beta' waves which have a cycle of 12 Hertz (Hz) carried information about the eyes, while 'theta' waves at 4Hz encoded information about the mouth.

The researchers also found information could be encoded depending on the phase - or timing of the brainwave - and less so by its amplitude - or strength.

A team from the University of Glasgow succeeded in decoding brain signals related to vision.

Six volunteers were shown images of people's faces displaying different emotions such as happiness, fear and surprise.

In a series of trials, parts of the images were randomly covered so that, for example, only the eyes or mouth were visible.

Participants were then asked to identify the emotion being displayed while electrodes attached to the scalp measured the volunteers' brainwaves.

The scientists were able to show that brainwaves varied greatly according to which part of the face was being looked at.

``Beta'' waves, with a frequency of 12 hertz, carried information about the eyes, while four hertz ``theta'' waves were linked to the mouth.

Information was also encoded by the phase, or timing, of the brainwave, and less so by its amplitude, or strength.

02-11-001_times,2011-01-04,Girls who mature early are at greater risk of depression when they reach their teens,"Girls who start having periods at a younger age are at greater risk of suffering symptoms of depression in adolescence, research suggests.

A long-term study involving more than 2,000 girls shows that those who matured earlier were more likely to have mood swings and more prone to distress by their early teens. 

Girls who started their periods after the age of 13½ had the lowest levels.

The mean age at which the girls, a cohort from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, started menstruating was 12½ years.

Researchers from the University of Bristol and the University of Cambridge said that the link between the timing of the first period and depressive symptoms suggested the need for greater awareness and support from schools and families.

Carol Joinson, the lead researcher, said the work supported earlier, smaller studies which suggested that later maturation may be protective against psychological distress.

""The transition into puberty is a critical developmental period, associated with many biological, cognitive and social changes,"" Dr Joinson said. 

""These can include increased conflict with parents, the development of romantic relationships, changes in body image and fluctuating hormone levels. 

Early maturing girls may feel isolated, and faced with demands which they are not emotionally prepared for.""

The authors said that other explanations such as the ""stressful change"" hypothesis were not supported by the findings. 

This theory proposes that puberty itself is a stressful event and that all girls will experience some level of distress at the time of the first period which then fades over time.

However the Avon research showed a higher level of depressive symptoms for early developers than for other groups. 

These symptoms persisted into mid-adolescence.

Another theory is that a girl experiencing an ""off-time"" maturation start, one which is out of sync with peers, might suffer more distress.

The research, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, involved an examination of the association between the onset of menstruation and depressive symptoms at the ages of 10½, 13 and 14.

Researchers found that girls who started their periods early (before the age of 11½ years) had the highest levels of depressive symptoms at the ages of 13 and 14.

Other possible contributory factors, such as absence of a father, money problems in the family and body mass index were also included in the analysis.

Dr Joinson said it was not clear from the study whether early menstruation is associated with persistent adverse effects on emotional development beyond mid-adolescence. 

The researchers pointed out that it is possible that girls who mature later may eventually experience similar levels of psychological distress to those who mature earlier.

""If girls who reach puberty early are at greater risk of psychological problems in adolescence, it may be possible to help them with school and family-based programmes aimed at early intervention and prevention,"" Dr Joinson concluded.

'They can face demands for which they are not emotionally prepared'

06-11-016_bbcnews,2011-07-17,Scientists find 'better way' to grow adult stem cells,"A new plastic surface which overcomes the difficulties associated with growing adult stem cells has been developed, according to scientists.

Standard surfaces have proved limited for growing large amounts and retaining the stem cells' useful characteristics.

It is hoped the discovery could lead to the creation of stem cell therapies for re-growing bone and tissue, and also for conditions such as arthritis.

The study was carried out by Glasgow and Southampton universities.

The new ""nano-patterned"" surface was created using a manufacturing process similar to that used to make Blu-ray discs.

The surface is covered with tiny pits, which the researchers said made it more effective in allowing stem cells to grow and spread into useful cells for therapy.

Currently, when adult stem cells are harvested from a patient, they are then cultured in a laboratory to increase the quantities of cells and create a batch of sufficient volume to kick-start the process of cellular regeneration. 

At this point they can be reintroduced back into the patient.

The process of culturing is made difficult because stem cells grown on standard plastic tissue culture surfaces do not always expand to create new stem cells but instead create other cells which are of no use in therapy. 

Stem cell expansion can be boosted by immersing the cells in chemical solutions, but the scientists said these methods were limited in their effectiveness.

Dr Matthew Dalby, from the University of Glasgow, led the research alongside colleague Dr Nikolaj Gadegaard and Prof Richard Oreffo of the University of Southampton.

'Stem cell factories'

Mr Dalby said: ""This new nano-structured surface can be used to very effectively culture mesencyhmal stem cells, taken from sources such as bone marrow, which can then be put to use in musculoskeletal, orthopaedic and connective tissues.

""If the same process can be used to culture other types of stem cells too - and this research is under way in our labs - our technology could be the first step on the road to developing large-scale stem cell culture factories, which would allow for the creation of a wide range of therapies for many common diseases such as diabetes, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.""

 

He said the group hoped to make the surface commercially available.

Prof Oreffo added: ""It is important to realise the ability to retain skeletal stem cell phenotype using surface topography offers a step change in current approaches for stem cell biology. 

""The implications for research and future interventions for patients with arthritis and other musculoskeletal diseases are substantial."" 

The study was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and the University of Glasgow.

The new analysis looked at the number and cause of deaths among the 4,605 patients based in the UK.

HEART pills taken by millions of Britons are even more powerful than previously thought and could save many more lives each year.

Research into cholesterolbusting statins has found that not only do they slash death rates from heart disease and strokes, they may also protect people from serious infections and respiratory disease.

More than six million people take statins to reduce harmful levels of artery-clogging ""bad"" LDL cholesterol.

The wonder drugs are credited with saving tens of thousands of lives in recent years.

But it was revealed yesterday that they can help cut the number of deaths from infections and respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia.

Professor Peter Sever, from the International Centre for Circulatory Health at Imperial College London, said: ""There is emerging evidence that there are increasing benefits of statins far beyond those that we had ever imagined when they were first introduced.

""This opens up a whole new area of research which is very exciting as they could be of much greater benefit to the health of the nation than we realised.

""From what we know about statins, not only do they have cholesterol-lowering benefits, they appear to suppress markers of inflammation and infection which could potentially be highly beneficial to patients.""

Prof Sever, who led a new study, presented his findings at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Paris yesterday as the research was simultaneously published in the European Heart Journal.

He found that eight years after a statins trial ended, they showed major benefits in reducing deaths from infection and respiratory illness.

The study - called Ascot, the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial - saw over 10,000 patients in the UK, Ireland and Scandinavia with high blood pressure allocated either atorvastatin or a placebo.

However, in 2003, the trial was stopped early because the statin proved to be so beneficial in preventing heart attacks and strokes that it was considered unethical to continue allowing people at risk to take a placebo.

Since then, most participants from both groups have been taking statins.

And Prof Sever said his new analysis has shown that eight years on, the most significant difference between the statin takers and those given the placebo is a reduction in deaths from infection and respiratory illness.

The analysis looked at the number and cause of deaths among the 4,605 participants in the Ascot trial who are based in the UK.

Among the UK participants, 460 of the original statin group have died, compared with 520 of the placebo group.

The difference is largely explained by a 36 per cent reduction in deaths from infection and respiratory illness.

Dr John Moore-Gillon, honorary medical adviser for the British Lung Foundation said: ""The apparent impact of statins on death rates from respiratory disease is a welcome, if unexpected, finding.""

It could mean that patients at higher risk of developing pneumonia could also be prescribed the drugs, despite a fear that too many ""worried well"" already take statins, which cost the NHS about £500million a year.

A study in The Lancet last month suggested some people taking the drugs were unlikely to gain any benefit.

Prof Peter Sever, from Imperial College London's international centre for circulatory health, said of the latest findings: ""This result is very unexpected.

The benefits of statins for preventing heart attacks and strokes are well established, but after long-term follow-up the most significant effects seem to be on deaths from other causes.""

There was now ""an emerging evidence base for statins protecting against infections"", said Prof Sever, who presented the results yesterday at the annual congress of the European Society of Cardiology in Paris.

A paper has also been published in the European Heart Journal.

He said: ""We know that if you are on a statin and you get pneumonia, you are less likely to die.

""There are about 15 observational studies that show statins protect you against worsening infection and death from infection.""

Prof Sever said the statins appeared to lessen the production of ""toxic"" inflammatory agents in the blood, which are stimulated by infections.

Prof Sever said: ""This study is going to make people think more about the non-cardiovascular benefits of statins.""

Prof Sever's team analysed the death certificates of almost 1,000 people.

They were among 10,000 volunteers with high blood pressure who had originally enrolled in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (Ascot) to test a type of statin, called atorvastatin.

They found that, 11 years after the Ascot trial started, deaths from infections and respiratory problems were 36 per cent lower in those originally given the statin, compared with those given a placebo.

Since the Ascot trial started, there were 37 deaths from infections and respiratory illness in the atorvastatin group, compared with 56 in the control group.

Prof Sever said of these differences: ""The numbers are large.

It's a very robust study.""

There was no difference in death rates from cancer.

Prof Sever, whose previous work helped formulate NHS guidelines for statin use, cautioned against widening statin prescription based on a single study.

He said: ""One swallow does not make a summer.""

Studies have shown that statins can cause side effects such as muscle weakness, and liver and kidney problems.

Others also questioned the validity of the data, noting the trial was not designed to look at causes of death other than from cardiovascular disease.

Guy De Backer, from Ghent University in Belgium, said: ""I want to remain cautious.

We all know that these findings can occur by chance alone.

They are interesting but they don't stand on their own.""

Those given the statin at the start of the Ascot trial were 14 per cent less likely to die during that period.

The trial was stopped after three years since atorvastatin had been shown to reduce the chance of a non-fatal heart attack and death from heart disease by 36 per cent.

Prof Sever said the lower rate of deaths from infections and respiratory illness over the 11-year period since the trial began was a ""carry over"" effect from being given atorvastatin at the start.

Prof Sever's study was funded by Pfizer, which makes atorvastatin.

However, the academic noted: ""I have no reason to believe that atorvastatin is unique in these non-cardiovascular actions.""

04-11-004_bbcnews,2011-03-24,Antibiotics have 'little effect' on cough and phlegm,"Taking antibiotics for a bad cough which produces green or yellow phlegm is of little benefit, says Cardiff University research.

A study of over 3,000 adults from across Europe found that patients producing coloured phlegm are more likely to be prescribed antibiotics by their GP.

Yet the antibiotic treatment did not appear to speed up their recovery.

The study appears in the European Respiratory Journal.

An acute cough or a lower respiratory tract infection is a very common reason for people going to see their GP in the UK, says the study.

Coughing up phlegm coloured green or yellow is also one of the most common reasons for GPs prescribing antibiotics, because they believe it is more likely to indicate a bacterial cause.

The team from the School of Medicine at Cardiff University collected data from 13 European countries for their research, asking patients and doctors to record symptoms and treatments for the condition.

The researchers found that patients who produced green or yellow phlegm were prescribed antibiotics ""considerably more often"" then those with clear or white phlegm.

They also found that, after seven days, the biggest difference between those who were and were not treated with antibiotics was less than one half of a percentage point on a symptom severity scale.

Side effects 

Professor Chris Butler, who led the study, said: ""Our findings resonate with findings from randomised trials where benefit from antibiotic treatment in those producing discoloured phlegm has been found to be marginal at best or non-existent."" 

""Our findings add weight to the message that acute cough in otherwise well adults is a self-limiting condition and antibiotic treatment does not speed recovery to any meaningful extent. 

""In fact, antibiotic prescribing in this situation simply unnecessarily exposes people to side effects from antibiotics, undermines future self care, and drives up antibiotic resistance,"" Professor Butler said.

The study also found that GPs from Scandinavia are good at targeting their prescribing of antibiotics while The Netherlands use half as many antibiotics than the UK.

Professor Butler added: ""Antibiotics can save people's lives, but we need to keep them away from people who will not benefit from them.""

02-11-022_dailymail,2011-05-18,LIFE-LONG OBESITY RISK OF 'EATING FOR TWO' IN PREGNANCY,"MOTHERS WON'T LOSE EXTRA WEIGHT, EXPERTSWARN

IT is advice that many an expectant mother will have heard as she settles down to a meal.

But 'eating for two' during pregnancy could leave women saddled with the extra pounds for life, researchers have found.

Pregnant women who gain excessive weight are at higher risk of obesity and health problems such as high blood pressure, later in life.

The findings, from a Bristol University study, add to mounting evidence about the harmful effects of being overweight during pregnancy.

Although weight gain during pregnancy is natural as the baby develops, research suggests that being fat puts baby and mother at risk.

The NHS advises that during the first six months of pregnancy, a woman's recommended energy intake of 1,940 calories a day does not change, so no extra food is required.

In the latter three months, the expectant mother needs only an additional 200 calories a day Ð equivalent to a ready-made fruit salad and yoghurt, or a small bowl of sugar-free muesli with grated apple.

The long-term Bristol study found that those who gained more than the recommended amount of weight during pregnancy were three times as likely to be overweight, obese or become 'apple-shaped' 16 years later.

But women who began pregnancy at a healthy weight and who gained only a little weight were much less likely to go on to become fat and develop related health problems.

The number of women who start their pregnancy obese has more than doubled in the past 20 years.

According to UK figures released last month, around 15 per cent of mothers are obese when expecting Ð up from seven per cent two decades earlier.

Doctors have warned that the problem is an ever-growing burden on the NHS and is jeopardising the health of the next generation.

Complications suffered by obese women in pregnancy range from diabetes to life-threatening pre-eclampsia, while babies born to fat women are at greater risk of diabetes and obesity.

Experts said the findings show the importance of being 'fit for pregnancy' Ð but they stressed that dieting was never recommended.

In the UK, there are no specific guidelines for how much weight a woman should gain during pregnancy.

The Bristol University team used U.S. advice to monitor 3,877 mothers in the west of England during pregnancy and again after 16 years.

Its results will be published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

Body mass index Ð worked out using a person's weight relative to their height Ð was used to determine if a woman was fat when she fell pregnant.

A BMI of 18.5 is underweight, 18.5 to 25 is healthy, 25 to 30 is overweight, and over 30 is obese.

The findings showed women who were underweight before pregnancy weighed on average two stones more when they gave birth.

The advice was to gain a maximum of two stones 11lb.

Women of healthy weight put on two stones 5lb, on average, within the recommended limit of two-and-a-half stones.

Overweight women gained an average of one stone 12lb, busting the limit of one stone 11lb, while obese women gained one stone 8lb Ð over the limit of one stone 5lb.

Altogether, half of overweight and obese women ate more than recommended levels for their pre-pregnancy weight, compared with one in five who started at a healthy weight.

Study leader Dr Abigail Fraser said women should avoid over-eating, particularly in the first six months when extra weight was laid down as fat before the baby really needed it for growth.

Weight is currently recorded only when an expectant mother goes for her first antenatal check. More regular checks were abandoned in the 1990s.

Dr Fraser said: 'Our findings suggest that regular monitoring of weight in pregnancy may need to be reconsidered because it provides a window of opportunity to prevent health problems later in life.'

The most important take-home message for women is to attain a healthy weight before conceiving, she added.

'You don't need to eat for two in pregnancy because this will cause you problems in later life, and is also linked to a higher risk of your baby becoming obese in childhood.'

New mothers are increasingly isolated, with almost a third living more than 40 miles from their close family, a survey commissioned by the National Childbirth Trust found.

Nearly a quarter didn't know other parents in their area and more than half spent less time with old friends who were childless after they became mothers.

17-11-007_dailymail,2011-06-03,WHY THE DEAF SEE BETTER THAN THOSE WHO CAN HEAR,"DEAF people have better eyesight than those who can hear, research shows.

Scientists discovered that the retinas of people born deaf, or who lost their hearing early in life, developed differently from those in people who can hear.

This gave them greater peripheral vision, allowing them to see more and thus increase their awareness of their surroundings and any potential hazards.

Researchers at the University of Sheffield discovered that retinal nerve cells are distributed differently in those who are deaf and those who can hear.

This makes them prioritise what they can see at their furthest peripheral vision, close to their ears.

While previous research had already uncovered the link between deafness and increased peripheral vision, scientists had thought the visual cortex in the brain was responsible, not the retinas.

Working on behalf of the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, the Sheffield researchers used ocular coherence tomography to scan the retinas of study participants.

Scientists dilated the pupils of the participants just before scanning their retinas.

They also measured their visual fields in both eyes to compare with the retina scans.

The results, published in the journal PLoS ONE, recorded a significant correlation between changes in retinal distribution in deaf individuals and the effect this had on widening their peripheral vision.

Study co-author Dr Charlotte Codina said: 'Our hope is that as we understand the retina and vision of deaf people better, we can improve visual care for deaf people.'","{""PLoS ONE"": 1}","{""Charlotte Codina"": 1}","{""the University of Sheffield"": 1, ""the Royal National Institute for Deaf People"": 1}","{""Charlotte Codina"": 1}","{""the University of Sheffield"": 1, ""the Royal National Institute for Deaf People"": 1}"

The team noticed the development in the retinas of adults who are either born deaf or become deaf when very young.

They also found that more visual information was transmitted than in people who could hear.

Dr Charlotte Codina said: ""Our hope is that as we understand the retina and vision of deaf people better, we can improve visual care for deaf people, the sense which is so profoundly important to them.""

Dr Ralph Holme, the head of biomedical research at RNID, Action on Hearing Loss, said: ""The better peripheral vision experienced by people who are deaf in comparison to those who hear has significant benefits for their everyday lives, including the ability to quickly spot hazards at the boundaries of their view.

The modification gives them better peripheral vision and increases their field of view.

Scientists found that the retinal nerve cells of individuals born deaf, or who went deaf very early in life, are distributed differently from those of hearing adults.

As a result their retinal neurons prioritise the region at the edge of vision, towards the ears.

Previous research suggested that deaf people can see further into the visual periphery than people who hear.

However, this was thought to be due to an adaptation in the visual centre of the brain.

'Our hope is that as we understand the retina and vision of deaf people better, we can improve visual care for deaf people, the sense which is so profoundly important to them,' said researcher Dr Charlotte Codina of Sheffield University.

07-11-017_express,2011-04-21,Test for migrants may curb TB surge,"SEVEN in 10 immigrants carrying tuberculosis are not being diagnosed when they arrive in the UK, a new study has found.

However, scientists say that a simple blood test could solve the problem and save the NHS millions of pounds.

In recent years, the number of cases of tuberculosis has jumped by 50 per cent to almost 10,000 a year, mainly due to immigration.

Although people arriving from sub-Saharan Africa are given chest X-rays to detect TB, this can only reveal those with active disease.

Many more immigrants have the bacteria lying dormant in their bodies, known as latent TB.

Professor Ajit Lalvani, from Imperial College London, whose findings are published in The Lancet online, said the discovery could end the link between TB and immigration.

""The societal impact of this finding is that TB is no longer the inevitable cost of immigration to the UK, "" he said.","{""Lancet"": 1}","{""Ajit Lalvani"": 1}","{""Imperial College London"": 1, ""Lancet"": 1}","{""Ajit Lalvani"": 1}","{""Imperial College London"": 1, ""Lancet"": 1}"
07-11-017_times,2011-04-21,Extra immigration checks urged as TB cases double,"Britain's tuberculosis screening programme is missing most cases of infection among immigrants and failing to prevent the ""relentless rise"" of the disease, experts have found.

The Health Protection Agency is urging officials to act after a study found that the current screening system was missing 70 per cent of latent TB infections brought in to Britain.

At present, immigrants from countries with high tuberculosis rates are given a chest X-ray on arrival to check for active TB.

But X-rays cannot identify the far greater numbers who are symptomless carriers of the disease, which often develops to the full-blown infectious version soon after they arrive in Britain.

Only immigrants from a handful of countries in Africa are given extra checks for latent TB infection.

Using a new blood test, researchers examined 1,229 immigrants in London, Leeds and Blackburn, discovering that 20 per cent of recent arrivals from the Indian sub-continent and 30 per cent from sub-Saharan Africa were carrying the disease.

The majority of these cases were missed by existing screenings.

Tuberculosis, a deadly disease in the Victorian era, when it was known as ""consumption"", was once thought to have been confined to the past, as antibiotics and vaccinations cut cases in Britain.

That has since been driven into reverse by arrivals from parts of the world where the disease remains common.

More than 9,000 cases of TB were detected in Britain last year, almost 50 per cent up on a decade ago.

""There has been a relentless rise over two decades,"" said Professor Ajit Lalvani of Imperial College London, who led the research.

""Rates in UK-born whites have not risen.

The increase has been driven by cases in immigrants.""

Latent infections can be easily eradicated with drugs, and Professor Lalvani said that better screening would ""stem the tide"" of tuberculosis in Britain.

""We have shown that by changing the threshold for screening, and including immigrants from the Indian sub-continent, we could pick up 92 per cent of imported latent tuberculosis,"" he added.

""By treating people at that early stage, we can prevent them from developing a serious illness and becoming infectious.""

Ibrahim Abubakar, a TB expert at the Health Protection Agency, who also worked on the study, said that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence had changed its guidelines as a result of the study.

""The key to reducing TB in the UK remains early diagnosis and treatment,"" he added.

A spokesman for the UK Border Agency said that it was reviewing the screening of new immigrants.

07-11-017_guardian,2011-04-21,"TB screening is missing 70% of latent cases: UK urged to test arrivals from Indian subcontinent X-rays fail to spot carriers, study finds, as cases double","The UK should radically change its tuberculosis screening policy and include arrivals from the Indian subcontinent, which could prevent most cases of the disease, according to scientists in a paper published today.

TB is a growing problem in the UK, where cases almost doubled between 1998 and 2009, and drug-resistant forms are spreading around the globe.

Arrivals from sub-Saharan Africa are X-rayed - but the test only picks up active TB cases, of which there are very few.

UK screening has been missing 70% of latent TB - where the person is a carrier and may become ill and infect others several years later.

Scientists writing in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal say TB screening could be more effective by using a blood test to pick up latent disease.

Professor Ajit Lalvani from Imperial College London and his colleagues studied a blood test for latent TB at three immigrant screening centres in the UK between 2008 and 2009, and collected data on the countries people had travelled from.

They discovered that 20% of recent immigrants from the Indian subcontinent and almost 30% from sub-Saharan Africa are carriers of latent tuberculosis.

They conclude that the current screening policy, which excludes immigrants from the Indian subcontinent - even though half of all active tuberculosis cases in the UK are in those populations - has been missing 70% of imported latent tuberculosis.

Changes to TB screening could pick up 92% of infected immigrants, they say, just by targeting younger people.

They recommend that anyone aged 35 or under from a country with TB prevalence of 150 cases per 100,000 people should be given the blood test for latent infection.

That would include people from the Indian sub-continent.

The change of policy, they say, would cost little more than what is spent at the moment, allowing for cases of active tuberculosis prevented.

""UK national guidance for which groups to screen has hitherto missed most immigrants with latent infection,"" said Lalvani.

""By changing the threshold, and including immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, we could pick up 92% of imported latent tuberculosis.

By treating people at that early stage, we can prevent them from developing a serious illness and becoming infectious.

Our findings provide the missing evidence-base for the new national strategy to expand immigrant screening.""

The shadow health minister, Diane Abbott, called for immediate action.

""It is alarming that we do not have comprehensive screening at ports of entry.

I will be calling on the UK national screening committee to look at proposals for a cost-effective screening programme,"" she said.

""Rates of tuberculosis continue to increase in many parts of the country.

Much of this rise affects disadvantaged communities, including certain ethnic minority groups and those with social risk factors such as homelessness and drug and alcohol misuse.

Using new blood checks rather than chest X-rays would detect over 90% of imported latent TB, experts said, as opposed to the current failure to detect more than 70% of cases of latent infection.

A team of researchers at Imperial College London said new methods of blood testing would mean that people with imported latent TB could be given a course of antibiotics to prevent them from developing an active form of the disease.

TB is caused by a bacterial infection which is normally asymptomatic, but around one in 10 infections leads to active disease, which attacks the lungs and kills around half of people affected.

The incidence of TB has risen dramatically in Britain over the last decade, particularly because of a 98% increase in cases among people who move to the country from overseas, the research said.

Current UK policy requires all immigrants from countries with a TB incidence higher than 40 in 100,000 people per year to have a chest X-ray on arrival to check for active TB, although very few immigrants have the active disease on arrival.

However, a substantial proportion of immigrants are carriers of latent TB which, though initially silent and non-infectious, often progresses to full-blown TB within a few years of arrival in the UK, researchers said.

Professor Ajit Lalvani, director of the Tuberculosis Research Unit at Imperial College London, who led the study, said: ""By treating people at that early stage, we can prevent them from developing a serious illness and becoming infectious.

Blood tests could prevent substantial numbers of cases, they write in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

The government said the research backed new guidance from health watchdog NICE.

Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterial infection, which attacks the lungs.

It has risen dramatically in the UK over the past decade, partly because of an increase in cases among people who move to the country from overseas.

Immigrants arriving in the UK from countries with a high incidence of TB are required to have a chest X-ray on arrival to check for TB.

But this screening method can miss cases where the infection lies dormant in the lungs and does not cause symptoms.

Professor Ajit Lalvani, of Imperial College London, argues that new blood tests should be used to pick-up cases where people are carrying TB infection but will not develop it for several years.

His research is based on an analysis of more than 1,000 immigrants at centres in London, Leeds and Blackburn.

07-11-017_reuters,2011-04-21,UK immigrant screening misses most latent TB: study,"British tuberculosis screening for new immigrants fails to detect most imported cases of latent disease and screening should be widened to include more people from the Indian subcontinent, scientists said on Thursday.

Britain has recently been dubbed ""the tuberculosis (TB) capital of Europe"" and is the only country in Western Europe with rising rates of disease.

Current British border policies require immigrants from countries with a TB incidence higher than 40 per 100,000 people to have a chest X-ray on arrival to check for active TB.

This generally covers African countries but excludes places in Asia such as India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

TB is caused by a bacterial infection which is normally asymptomatic, but about one in 10 cases lead to active disease which attacks the lungs and kills around half of those affected.

While very few immigrants have active TB on arrival, many of them are carriers of the latent disease, which often progresses to active TB within a few years of their arrival in Britain.

To see whether the screening was effective, British researchers analyzed demographic and test result data from 2008 to 2010 at three immigrant screening centers in Britain using a highly specific blood test for detecting latent tuberculosis, called an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA).

Their results, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, showed 20 percent of recent immigrants from the Indian sub-continent and almost 30 percent from sub-Saharan Africa are carriers of latent TB.

This means the current screening policy, which excludes immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, has been missing 70 percent of imported latent TB, they said.

TB is a worldwide pandemic. Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 13 are in Africa, while a third of all new cases are in India and China, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The WHO also says drug-resistant TB is rapidly increasing around the world and these often fatal strains of the disease are expected to affect two million people by 2050.

COST EFFECTIVE

Britain has more than 9,000 cases of TB diagnosed a year and the problem is becoming particularly acute in the capital, which experts say accounts for 40 percent of the nation's total diagnosed cases.

In this study, the researchers also assessed how cost-effective it would be to lower the threshold so people from more countries are screened.

They found including immigrants from the Indian subcontinent would detect over 90 percent of latent TB cases, and would cost little more than now.

""By changing the threshold for screening, and including immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, we could pick up 92 percent of imported latent TB,"" said Ajit Lalvan from Imperial College London, who led the study.

""By treating people at that early stage, we can prevent them from developing a serious illness and becoming infectious.""

The national incidence of TB has risen dramatically over the last decade, increasing by almost 50 percent between 1998 and 2009.

Much of this increase has been driven by a 98 percent increase in cases among immigrants.

Writing in the British Medical Journal, UK and Pakistani experts assessed 43 studies involving 200,000 children, and found deaths were cut by 24% if children were given the vitamin.

And they say taking it would also cut rates of measles and diarrhoea.

The body needs vitamin A for the visual and immune systems to work properly.

It is found in foods including cheese, eggs, liver and oily fish.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that, around the world, 190 million children under the age of five may have a vitamin A deficiency. 

But despite widespread efforts, supplementation programmes do not reach all the children who could benefit. 

Capsules are now distributed twice a year in at least 60 countries, with average annual coverage rates nearing 80%.

However, University of Oxford and Aga Khan University researchers who carried out this work say the effectiveness of vitamin A is so well-established that policy-makers should provide supplements to all children at risk. 

'Effective and cheap' 

They evaluated studies that involved children aged six months to five years, and compared rates of illness and death among those who were given vitamin A and those who were not. 

They found vitamin A supplements reduced child mortality by 24% in low- and middle-income countries. 

They calculate that, considering the estimated 190m children who are vitamin A deficient, reducing deaths by 24% would save more than 600,000 lives each year.

Dr Evan Mayo-Wilson from the University of Oxford, who worked on the study, said: ""Until other sources are available, supplements should be given to all children who are at risk of vitamin A deficiency. 

""After just one year, children who had taken supplements were less likely to have died than children who received a placebo [dummy version]. 

Vitamin A supplements are highly effective and cheap to produce and administer.""

He said there had been recent criticism of vitamin A programmes - with some saying there were risks that respiratory infection rates could increase, particularly in children who were not vitamin A deficient - but he added there was ""little doubt"" that vitamin A prevented young children from dying. 

In an editorial for BMJ Online, Professor Wafaie Fawzi, from the department of nutrition, epidemiology, and global health at Harvard School of Public Health, added: ""Effort should now focus on finding ways to sustain this important child survival initiative and fine tune it to maximise the number of lives saved.""","{""British Medical Journal"": 1, ""BMJ Online"": 1}","{""Evan Mayo-Wilson"": 1, ""Wafaie Fawzi"": 1}","{""the British Medical Journal"": 1, ""The World Health Organization"": 1, ""WHO"": 1, ""University of Oxford"": 1, ""Aga Khan University"": 1, ""the University of Oxford"": 1, ""BMJ Online"": 1, ""Harvard School of Public Health"": 1}","{""Evan Mayo-Wilson"": 1, ""Wafaie Fawzi"": 1}","{""University of Oxford"": 2, ""Aga Khan University"": 1, ""the University of Oxford"": 1, ""BMJ Online"": 1, ""Harvard School of Public Health"": 1}"

Those with the ‘sleep switch’ needed almost 30 minutes more rest each night than those without","One in five Europeans carry the variant of ABCC9, which is involved in sensing energy levels of cells in the body.

Those with the ‘sleep switch’ needed almost 30 minutes more rest each night than those without.

Experts hope the finding will help future sleep studies establish how the gene variant regulates sleep duration. 

Edinburgh scientists worked alongside researchers from Ludwig Maximilians University Munich to study genes in fruit flies and human sleep patterns.

Flies without the ABCC9 variant slept for three hours less than normal, while humans with it slept for longer than the ‘average’ eight hours.

More than 10,000 people throughout Europe – including 1,000 Scots – took part in the study, providing information on how many hours they slept each night and a blood sample to analyse their DNA.

Sleep was measured on ‘free days’  – when people did not need to get up for work the next day, take sleeping pills or work shifts. 

Dr Jim Wilson, of Edinburgh University’s Centre for Population Health  Sciences, said sleep plays a hugely important role in our health.

He added: ‘I was staggered when we found this gene variant, given the obvious health difficulties people suffer as a consequence of a lack of sleep.

‘You have to understand a problem before you can do something about it. 

Hopefully more genes will now be discovered and this can also lead to us dealing better with the connected health issues.’

Researchers also found the length of time people slept for often ran in families, despite the fact that the amount of sleep people need can be influenced by age, latitude, season and circadian (24 hour) rhythms.

Dr Wilson said he believed the study would help reveal the health effects of different sleep behaviours.

He added: ‘I don’t think it’s as simple as people with the gene going to bed 30 minutes earlier but today we are a step closer to tackling the problems for people who struggle to sleep.’

More than 10,000 people throughout Europe took part in a study providing information on how many hours they slept, along with a blood sample to analyse their DNA.

The results showed those carrying the gene ABCC9 slept longer than the average of eight hours.

The variant is carried by one in five Europeans, they say in their study, published in Molecular Psychiatry.

The researchers said the finding could help explain ""sleep behaviour"".

Over 10,000 people took part, each reporting how long they slept and providing a blood sample for DNA analysis.

People's sleep needs can differ significantly.

At the extreme, Margaret Thatcher managed on four hours of sleep a night while Albert Einstein needed 11.

People from the Orkney Isles, Croatia, the Netherlands, Italy, Estonia and Germany took part in the study.

All were asked about their sleep patterns on ""free"" days, when people did not need to get up for work the next day, take sleeping pills or work shifts. 

When the researchers from the University of Edinburgh and Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich compared these figures with the results of the genetic analysis, they found those with a variation of a gene known as ABCC9 needed more sleep than the eight-hour average.

They then looked at how the gene works in fruit flies, who also have it and found flies without ABCC9 slept for three hours less than normal.

The gene ABCC9 is involved in sensing energy levels of cells in the body. 

They say this opens up a new line of research in sleep studies, and it is hoped that future work could establish exactly how this gene variant regulates how long people sleep for.

Researchers found the PET-CT scan, commonly used to detect cancer, can also find 5p-sized benign tumours in the adrenal glands.

Conn's syndrome is the cause of high blood pressure in 5% of cases.

It is tricky to diagnose but an estimated 600,000 could have it.

Study leader Morris Brown, of Cambridge University said: ""PET-CT could be a quick way to reassure patients without detailed investigations.""",,"{""Morris Brown"": 1}","{""Cambridge University"": 1, ""PET-CT"": 1}","{""Morris Brown"": 1}","{""Cambridge University"": 1, ""PET-CT"": 1}"
03-11-042_bbcnews,2011-11-29,Scan can spot 'curable cause of high blood pressure',"Doctors say they have found a medical test can diagnose the most common curable cause of high blood pressure. 

Conn's syndrome - a disease of the adrenal glands that sit above the kidneys - is thought to be the cause behind one in 20 cases of hypertension.

But until now it has been difficult to detect, requiring a complex series of tests on blood taken from a vein supplying the adrenal gland.

Experts at the University of Cambridge say a simple scan can spot the problem.

The hi-tech PET-CT scan looks for small growths in the adrenal glands that are about the size of a five pence piece, the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism reports. 

These benign growths or tumours - called adenomas - pump out too much of a hormone called aldosterone, which in turn raises blood pressure. 

The latest work builds on a discovery by other researchers of a special radioactive tracer called 11C-metomidate, which lights up culprit adenomas in the scan.

Once the problem is identified the condition can be treated either by surgically removing the affected gland or by using a drug to block the effects of aldosterone.

This is important because high blood pressure greatly increases the risk of heart attack and stroke.

After initial success in 44 patients, the Cambridge team is now using the scan on any patients they suspect to have Conn's syndrome. 

Reassurance 

Lead researcher Prof Morris Brown said: ""We were excited to see our technique work so well, and shortcut the delays and discomforts associated with the alternative test. 

""We're using PET-CT on our patients already, but we also plan a larger study to work out who will benefit the most.""

He says the test could be especially important for older patients.

""We often see growths in the adrenal glands during a routine CT scan.

Often these growths are not Conn's adenomas, but it's difficult to be sure and they create a lot of anxiety in patients and doctors. 

""In the future PET-CT could be a quick way to reassure a lot of patients without the need for detailed investigations.""

Dr Shannon Amoils, of the British Heart Foundation, which part-funded the work, said getting an accurate diagnosis would mean thousands of patients could potentially be cured of high blood pressure.

12-11-030_dailymail,2011-08-26,CANCER SCORING TO PREDICT HOW LONG YOU MAY LIVE,"Doctors have developed a scoring system that can give cancer patients a reliable idea of how long they have left to live.

The aim is to help the terminally ill and their carers to plan for the future.

A study of more than 1,000 patients found the system was at least as accurate as clinicians at predicting whether they were likely to survive for days, weeks or months.

Dr Paddy Stone, from St George's, University of London, said: 'Patients with advanced cancer and their carers often wish to know how long they have left to live.

'Accurate information can allow patients adequate time to prepare for their impending death.'

The information is also important for planning appropriate medical care.

Clinicians' predictions of survival are the mainstay of current practice, but can be unreliable, over-optimistic and subjective, say the researchers.

So Dr Stone's team set out to develop a scoring system for use in patients with advanced cancer in different care settings that was as good, or better, than clinicians' best predictions.

The study, published online in the British Medical Journal, involved 1,018 patients with advanced incurable cancer who were no longer receiving treatment and had recently been referred to palliative care services across the UK.

Using a combination of clinical and laboratory tests, the team created two scores, known as PiPS-A and PiPS-B, to predict whether patients were likely to survive for up to 13 days, between 14 and 55 days, or more than this.

They compared the results with actual survival and clinicians' predictions.

Both scores were at least as accurate as a clinician's estimate.

PiPS-B, which required a blood test, was significantly better than an individual doctor's or nurse's prediction.

However, neither scale was significantly more accurate than a multi-professional estimate of survival.

The researchers say further work is needed before the scales can be recommended for use in routine clinical practice.

Dr Paul Glare, of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre in New York, reviewed the findings for the journal and says prognostic tools can help, but should not be applied blindly.

Dr Glare pointed out that 'communicating the prediction to the patient is as important as forecasting it'.

The system has been welcomed by Cancer Research UK.

The charity's Liz Woolf said: 'Although this scale would provide an indication rather than definite information on how long cancer patients have left to live, it could prove useful to patients, families and clinicians who are wondering whether to begin discussions around palliative care.

'Often this conversation is left until it is too late to make arrangements while patients wait to know what their prognosis is.

18-11-012_bbcnews,2011-12-07,Bisphosphonates 'extend hip replacement life',"Using a bone-strengthening drug could make joint replacements last longer, according to an analysis of GPs' records.

The study, published on the British Medical Journal website, showed that the failure rate could be cut in half.

Researchers analysed data from patients who were taking bisphosphonates, which are used to prevent the loss of bone material.

However, scientists say further studies are still needed.

When joints become damaged or worn out, commonly due to osteoarthritis, it can be painful and limits movement.

An implant can dramatically improve a patient's mobility. More than 50,000 hip and 70,000 knee, replacements take place in the UK each year. 

Too loose 

While they can last for decades, some fail within years.

This can happen when the bone around the implant is dissolved by the body meaning the replacement joint becomes loose.

The theory was that bisphosphonates, which are used by patients with osteoporosis to prevent bone being broken down, would prevent the loosening.

The researchers looked at data from General Practice Research Database for joint replacements and compared what happened to 1,912 patients taking bisphosphonates with 41,995 patients who did not.

After five years, 1.96% of implants failed without the drug, compared with 0.93% in those taking medication.

Prof Nigel Arden, a specialist in rheumatic diseases at the Universities of Oxford and Southampton, said the first implant would cost the NHS about £7,000, but replacements would cost £34,000.

He told the BBC: ""It has the potential to have a huge impact."" 

He said two of the risk factors, age and obesity, meant the number of cases was ""increasing dramatically"".

Prof Arden is not arguing that people should be given the drug yet.

He has applied for funding for a further trial to test the effectiveness of bisphosphonates and which patients would benefit most.

The chief medical officer for England, Prof Dame Sally Davies welcomed the findings.

""With such a high incidence of knee and hip replacement surgery, the possibility that the life of joint implants could be lengthened and reduce the number of complex revision surgeries means that these results have the potential to make significant improvements to the lives of many NHS patients,"" she said.","{""British Medical Journal"": 1}","{""Nigel Arden"": 1, ""Arden"": 1, ""Prof Dame"": 1, ""Sally Davies"": 1}","{""GPs"": 1, ""the British Medical Journal"": 1, ""General Practice Research Database"": 1, ""the Universities of Oxford"": 1, ""NHS"": 1, ""BBC"": 1}",,"{""the Universities of Oxford"": 1, ""NHS"": 2}"

06-11-023_bbcnews,2011-10-03,Men 'more prone to type 2 diabetes',"Researchers say they have discovered why men may be more likely than women to develop type 2 diabetes - they are biologically more susceptible.

Men need to gain far less weight than women to develop the condition, study findings suggest.

The Glasgow University team found men developed the disease at a lower Body Mass Index (BMI) than women.

They believe distribution of the body fat is important - men tend to store it in their liver and around the waist.

Women, meanwhile, have greater amounts of 'safe' subcutaneous fat stored on the thighs and hips, for example. 

This means women need to accumulate more fat overall than men to develop the harmful fat deposits linked with diabetes, the researchers explain in the journal Diabetologia.

Body fat 

Type 2 diabetes is caused by too much sugar in the blood which occurs when the body's ability to regulate sugar levels in several different organs becomes disturbed.

The condition is linked to excess fat in some of these organs such as the liver and muscles.

Professor Naveed Sattar, of the Institute of Cardiovascular & Medical Sciences, who led the research, said: ""Previous research has indicated that middle-aged men are at a higher risk of developing diabetes than women and one possible explanation is that men have to gain less weight than women to develop the condition. 

""In other words, men appear to be at higher risk for diabetes.""

For the study, the researchers analysed data from 51,920 men and 43,137 women in Scotland with diabetes, taking into consideration body weight and obesity using the BMI measurement based on height and weight. 

The results showed women developed diabetes at a heavier BMI than men - the mean BMI at diabetes diagnosis in men was 31.83 but 33.69 in women. 

The researchers say this helps explain why men have higher rates of diabetes in many parts of the world.

Dr Victoria King, Head of Research at Diabetes UK, said: ""It is worrying that men develop type 2 diabetes at a higher rate than their female counterparts.

19-11-002_dailymail,2011-01-26,How central heating is making you fat: Sitting in your cosy home stops you from burning calories,"It already adds unwanted pounds to your winter fuel bills.

And having the heating on high could also pile extra pounds on your weight, scientists believe.

Experts say many of us now keep our homes so cosy that we no longer have to burn as many calories to naturally warm up our bodies.

Modern centrally heated homes with efficient double glazing are helping to send obesity rates soaring, a study claims.

Scientists from University College London say it is an increasing problem across the developed world where average indoor temperatures are constantly rising.



And its impact on weight is made worse by the extra time we now spend indoors, whether working from home or shopping online.

Even when we do venture out, it is often via heated cars or other transport to offices and workplaces where the temperature is carefully controlled by air conditioning units.

The research, in the journal Obesity Reviews, said there was a direct link between ‘reduced exposure to seasonal cold and increases in obesity in the UK and U.S.’.

If the body is already warm it does not need to convert a ‘brown’ fat known as adipose tissue into energy to generate heat, the study said. 

Brown fat was previously thought to be present only in infants, playing a vital role in keeping them warm, but recent research found it also in adults.

This latest study suggested that prolonged exposure to comfortable warm temperatures may permanently reduce the body’s ability to burn this brown fat.

Lead author Fiona Johnson said: ‘Increased time spent indoors, widespread access to central heating and air conditioning, and increased expectations of thermal comfort all contribute to restricting the range of temperatures we experience in daily life.

‘This reduces the time our bodies spend under mild thermal stress – meaning we’re burning less energy.

‘This could have an impact on energy balance and ultimately have an impact on body weight and obesity.’

She called for health strategies to look at heating just as they currently look at other environmental factors such as diet and exercise.

Study co-author Marcella Ucci said: ‘The findings suggest that lower winter temperatures in buildings might contribute to tackling obesity as well as reducing carbon emissions.’","{""Obesity Reviews"": 1}","{""Brown"": 1, ""Fiona Johnson"": 1, ""Marcella"": 1}","{""University College London"": 1, ""Obesity Reviews"": 1, ""Ucci"": 1}","{""Fiona Johnson"": 1, ""Marcella"": 1}","{""University College London"": 1}"

For modern living with the central heating turned up and efficient double glazing preventing cold draughts are helping to send obesity rates soaring, a new study claims. 

Britons are getting so used to being warm and cosy in their homes that their bodies no longer have to use up as much energy to ward off the cold leading to weight gain. 

It is a growing problem across the developed world where average indoor temperatures are constantly rising, said the study by scientists from London university UCL. 

The added time spent indoors, whether working from home or shopping online instead of going out, is only adding to the obesity problem. 

Even if they do go out it is often into heated cars or other transport to offices and workplaces where the temperature is carefully governed by air conditioning units. 

The research, published in the journal Obesity Reviews, said there was a direct link between ""reduced exposure to seasonal cold and increases in obesity in the UK and US"". 

If the body is warm it does not need to produce its own energy to do so and may also lose some of its ability to produce heat as a result, said the study. 

When the body is cold it produces brown fat known as adipose tissue which burns energy to create heat, it said. 

But homes in developed countries have been getting gradually warmer over the years through more efficient heating or people expecting a greater level of comfort in their living rooms and so turning the thermostat up. 

And spending greater periods of time in these warmer environments could see the body losing its ability to create brown adipose tissue, said UCL lead author Dr Fiona Johnson. 

She said: ""Increased time spent indoors, widespread access to central heating and air conditioning, and increased expectations of thermal comfort all contribute to restricting the range of temperatures we experience in daily life. 

""This reduces the time our bodies spend under mild thermal stress – meaning we're burning less energy. 

""This could have an impact on energy balance and ultimately have an impact on body weight and obesity."" 

She called for health strategies should look at heating just as they currently look at other environmental factors such as diet and exercise. 

The co-author, Marcella Ucci, added: ""The findings suggest that lower winter temperatures in buildings might contribute to tackling obesity as well reducing carbon emissions."" 

The research found that average living room temperatures have inched up around half a degree centigrade (one degree Fahrenheit) every decade and now average more than 20C (68F). 

The body starts to heat itself if it drops below the ""thermoneutral zone"" which is around 25C (77F). 

A four centigrade rise in temperature reduces the amount of energy used to heat the body by as much as 800 calories.","{""Obesity Reviews"": 1}","{""Fiona Johnson"": 1, ""Marcella"": 1}","{""UCL"": 2, ""Obesity Reviews"": 1, ""Ucci"": 1}","{""Fiona Johnson"": 1, ""Marcella"": 1}","{""UCL"": 2}"
19-11-002_metro,2011-01-26,Central heating could be making you fat according to scientists,"Having your central heating on can lead to a lack of physical activity, which can lead to obesity, according to scientists. 



Central heating could be making you fat, apparently 

As well as centrally heated homes, we've apparently been spoiled by double glazed windows and insulation which help to keep to the heat in our homes.

University College London scientists say that the average temperature of a home is rising proportionately with obesity levels across the developed world.

The researchers also suggested that when we do leave the house, we are still being treated to warm temperatures in modes of transport, places of work and public buildings such as shopping centres. 

Lead author of the research, Fiona Johnson said: ‘Increased time spent indoors, widespread access to central heating and air conditioning, and increased expectations of thermal comfort all contribute to restricting the range of temperatures we experience in daily life. 

‘This reduces the time our bodies spend under mild thermal stress – meaning we’re burning less energy. 

‘This could have an impact on energy balance and ultimately have an impact on body weight and obesity.’

The findings, claim the researchers, point towards a change in the way we see heating, as lower temperatures could help to facilitate weight loss.

02-11-027_times,2011-07-11,Genetic study could produce a drug for cruel back condition,"A set of genes that influence a painful back and joint disorder affecting 200,000 Britons has been identified, offering hope of new treatments.

A study of more than 5,000 people with ankylosing spondylitis has linked eight new DNA variants to the autoimmune disease, which affects up to one in 200 men and one in 500 women.

One of the genes, called ERAP1, points to a biological mechanism that may explain many cases of the condition.

This insight could lead to drugs that calm down the over-active immune system that causes ankylosing spondylitis and control the disease.

""As we understand better how these genetic factors operate, we may be able to use that understanding to develop new therapies,"" said Professor Peter Donnelly, director of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics at the University of Oxford, who led the international study.

Ankylosing spondylitis principally affects the spine, causing stiffness, inflammation, curvature and back pain.

It can also affect other joints, tendons and ligaments, and in rarer cases the eyes, lungs, bowel and heart.

The condition generally begins between the ages of 15 and 35.

While the inflammation and pain can be managed, there is no cure.

The results of the study, published in the journal Nature Genetics, linked three genetic variants conclusively to a raised risk of ankylosing spondylitis, and found four more that were strongly associated with the disease.

The study also found an interaction between the ERAP1 gene and a gene called HLA-B27, which has been known for almost 40 years to be a significant factor in ankylosing spondylitis.

People with the HLA-B27 variant have up to 80 times the normal risk of developing it.

But those with HLA-B27 who also have a certain version of ERAP1 have a risk four times lower than normal, suggesting that ERAP1 has a powerful protective effect.

""It seems to slow down the immune system, so it can't work too hard and cause problems.

That naturally leads to the suggestion of possible drug therapies that do the same thing,"" Professor Donnelly said.","{""Nature Genetics"": 1}","{""Peter Donnelly"": 1, ""Donnelly"": 1}","{""the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics"": 1, ""the University of Oxford"": 1, ""Nature Genetics"": 1, ""ERAP1"": 2}","{""Peter Donnelly"": 1, ""Donnelly"": 2}","{""the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics"": 1, ""the University of Oxford"": 1, ""Nature Genetics"": 1}"
02-11-027_independent,2011-07-11,Breakthrough offers hope to thousands with arthritis;,"A genetic breakthrough into the causes of an incurable spine condition could help tens of thousands of young people avoid pain and disability.

Scientists from the University of Bristol have discovered seven genes involved in ankylosing spondylitis (AS), an autoimmune arthritis that causes debilitating joint pain for an estimated 200,000 Britons. 

The findings pave the way for better diagnostic tests and new treatments for AS sufferers, but could prove important for other conditions, according to research in Nature Genetics.

Two of the seven genetic mutations are also involved in other common autoimmune diseases including Crohn's and coeliac disease. 

AS affects one in every 200 Europeans, and is three times more common in men than women. Common symptoms, which tend to manifest themselves in the late teens or early 20s, include episodes of severe stiffness and pain in the lower back, although the pelvis, neck, hip and knees can also be affected.

Painful joints are accompanied by extreme fatigue, but the symptoms are frequently mistaken for sports injuries.

Delays in diagnosis are also caused by the fact doctors have, until now, relied upon X-rays and a complicated, expensive genetic test. 

But the Wellcome Trust-funded project has uncovered a connection between two genetic mutations in AS which will make it much easier, and cheaper, to diagnose patients at the early stages of the disease.

Dr David Evans, lead author and senior lecturer in statistical genetics at the University of Bristol said:""Patients who are diagnosed earlier have a much better prognosis because they get the right drugs and physiotherapy.""

05-11-020_scotsman,2011-07-09,Scientists find why it's tough to teach old dogs new tricks,"SCOTTISH scientists have discovered why we find it easier to learn things we already know about - but struggle with newer subjects.

The researchers, from Edinburgh University, said people would assume it was simpler to pick up on unfamiliar information as it was arguably newer and more interesting.

But they have found that adding to things we already have some knowledge of is much easier.

The key to this learning conundrum appears to be down to how certain parts of our brain respond to new and old information.

The Edinburgh team used animal experiments to focus on what was happening in the brain during different types of learning.

The animals were either presented with a maze test with which they were familiar or one that was completely new.

Looking at what was happening in their brains, the scientists discovered that building on knowledge already possessed activated a key set of genes found in the brain which were important to learning.

But these so-called ""plasticity"" genes did not respond as well to subjects of which there was little knowledge, according to the study in the journal Science.

The scientists, working with colleagues in Tokyo, said this made it more difficult for people to form new memories about unfamiliar topics, meaning we have to work extra hard to get them to lodge in the grey matter.

Lead researcher Professor Richard Morris, from Edinburgh University, said: ""This curious effect is seen in a specific part of the cortex [area of the brain] whose functions are still poorly understood, so there is still much work to be done.

""But a combination of biomedical and human brain imaging work has this as a key aim for future research.

""We also plan to look at how professional knowledge is gradually acquired and organised in the brain.""

Prof Morris said many people believed you learn best when something novel happens, making it easier to remember.

""But there's a paradox in that if we have an established body of knowledge, like a child who knows football teams backwards, they seem to be able to assimilate new information relevant to that background knowledge much more easily than the rest of us would.""

""They can remember some odd goal or player.

That kind of information is not really novel as it is quite closely linked to the person's body of knowledge, and the same applies in the professional field whether you're in academic life or the legal world.

""The tests found that learning this kind of information where there was already some knowledge base activated the genes in the brain, while trying to pick up new information did not, making it more difficult to remember.""

Prof Morris said in future they hoped the findings could help lead to new educational strategies to boost learning.

""So much of what we do in the educational world is based on past experience rather than on really informed knowledge of how the brain learns in terms of these plasticity genes,"" he said.

""So we would like to think we are getting a handle on the mechanisms by which we can most easily assimilate new information and this could have repercussions for the way we might think about optimal ways of designing education courses.""","{""Science"": 1}","{""Richard Morris"": 1, ""Morris"": 2}","{""Edinburgh University"": 2}","{""Richard Morris"": 1, ""Morris"": 3}","{""Edinburgh University"": 2}"
04-11-001_dailymail,2011-04-04,THE FIVE GENETIC CLUES THAT COULD HELP PREVENT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE,"FIVE genetic links to Alzheimer's have been discovered, raising the prospect of future treatments to prevent the disease.

The discoveries mean a total of ten genes are now known to play a role in late-onset Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia.

Eradicating the effects of all of them would remove 60 per cent of the illness in the population, or 300,000 cases.

Lead researcher Professor Julie Williams, of Cardiff University, said the findings mean it may one day be possible to identify those most at risk.

'In 10 to 15 years' time we may be taking drugs to prevent the onset of Alzheimer's in the same way as we take statins to prevent the onset of heart disease,' she said.

Some 750,000 people in the UK are living with dementia. By 2021 this is set to soar to almost a million as the population ages.

Up to 79 per cent of a person's susceptibility is thought to be determined by genes.

The findings, published in the Nature Genetics journal, focused on genes affecting the immune system, cholesterol processing, and a cellular process that removes toxic protein from the brain.

The genes affect the make-up of the immune system, how brains handle cholesterol and how cells absorb molecules such as proteins.

Examining how sufferers' DNA to Alzheimer's may pave the way for new drugs that prevent 60% of cases.

Cardiff University's Prof Julie Williams, who led one of two breakthrough studies, said: ""Over the next few years we will understand a lot more about the genetics of Alzheimer's.

Within 10 years we may know enough to make a pretty good prediction on whether people might go on to develop Alzheimleads er's.""

Drugs to prevent the ailment could be available in 15 years.

Her study was one of two that looked at 80,000 people in total in Europe and the US. Five other genes are also known to be linked to the condition.

The first was discovered 19 years ago and the other four in 2009. Alzheimer's accounts for nearly two-in-three of Britain's 800,000 dementia cases.

It claims 60,000 lives and costs the UK pounds 23 billion a year - twice as much as cancer and three times as much as heart disease.

The breakthrough - described as a ""step towards defeating dementia"" - means a total of 10 genes are now known to be linked with the illness.

Removing the effects of these genes could reduce by 60 per cent, or almost 300,000, the number of cases in the UK.

Professor Julie Williams, who led the researchers at the University of Cardiff, said it may soon be possible to identify patients most at risk from the disease and offer them drugs to prevent it.

She said: ""I can envisage in 10 to 15 years' time we may be taking a number of drugs to prevent the onset of Alzhei mer's in the same way as we take statins now to prevent heart disease.""

Dr Susanne Sorensen, of the Alzhe imer's Society, said: ""These studies will give scientists clues as to how the dis ease might develop.

Most importantly their identification could also lead to the development of drug treatments in the longer term.""

The research, by teams in Britain and America, involved analysing the DNA of nearly 60,000 people with and without the disease.

Prof Williams, whose research is pub lished in Nature Genetics, said that eventually a simple blood test could be used to identify signs of the disease.

She said: ""What is exciting about our findings is that the genetic variations we've found all fit together.

Modern technology has allowed us to complete this work and we're really getting to the crux of what causes Alzheimer's.""

The research brings the known number of genes associated with Alzheimer's to 10, which together account for about 300,000 cases of the disease in Britain.

The findings raise the prospect of earlier testing and better treatments for a condition that costs the UK £23bn a year in long-term care and lost productivity, according to a dementia report commissioned last year by the Alzheimer's Research Trust.

Scientists discovered the five genes by comparing the genetic makeup of tens of thousands of patients with those of healthy volunteers.

Genes account for 60%-80% of our chance of developing late-onset Alzheimer's, the rest coming from lifestyle and environmental factors.

Having high blood pressure in middle age is known to raise the risk of developing Alzheimer's later in life.

The work is described in two studies published in Nature Genetics, led by Julie Williams at Cardiff University and Gerard Schellenberg at the University of Pennsylvania.

The emerging picture of Alzheimer's is of a disease driven by subtle genetic factors whose effects build up throughout life and ultimately cause the steady and irreversible destruction of brain cells.

Most Alzheimer's sufferers have the late-onset strain, which develops after the age of 65.

Five new genetic variants have been discovered, doubling the number already known, and together they account for 60 per cent of all cases of the disease.

The discovery could lead to preventive treatments within the next 15 years, it was claimed.

Some of the genes are linked to inflammation and cholesterol in the brain, which means that existing drugs could already exist to treat them.

Others suggest whole new mechanisms not previously linked to the disease.

""If we eradicate the effect of these genes, we could eradicate 60 per cent of Alzheimer's,"" said Prof Julie Williams of Cardiff University, who led the study.

04-11-001_independent,2011-04-04,A test for Alzheimer's disease - but will anyone want to take it?,"Important new insights into Alzheimer's disease have emerged from the discovery of a handful of genes that are strongly implicated in raising a person's risk of developing the brain disorder in later life.

The findings could eventually lead to a genetic test to predict the likelihood of suffering from Alzheimer's after a certain age, although the scientists behind the research warn that there will be difficult ethical dilemmas posed by a test for a debilitating and fatal disorder that has no cure or effective treatment.

A series of landmark studies published last night links five additional genes to Alzheimer's disease.

This brings to 10 the total number of genes that are associated with the condition, which typically strikes after 65 and is marked by memory loss and dementia.

British researchers said the 10 genes accounted for about 20 per cent of the overall cause of Alzheimer's disease (about a third of the genetic contribution to the disease).

If faults in all 10 genes could be corrected, it would eliminate about 60 per cent of Alzheimer's cases, scientists said.

Alzheimer's disease affects about 500,000 people in Britain but the number affected by dementia is growing rapidly with an ageing population - it is expected to reach 1 million by 2021.

Sufferers need expensive, long-term care and the total ""health burden"" cost to society is estimated to be £23bn a year for the UK alone.

Scientists are attempting to understand why the ageing brain develops Alzheimer's by studying the entire genomes of elderly people with and without the condition.

By doing this, the researchers are able to tease out changes to the key genes that exert an influence on a person's risk factor.

The latest studies, in Britain, the US and Europe and published in the journal Nature Genetics, scanned the genomes of about 60,000 people, identifying small genetic variations in the five genes that can now be linked with the disease.

Eventually, this kind of research should lead to genetic tests that can estimate in middle age the probability of a person developing Alzheimer's.

Professor Mike Owen of Cardiff University's School of Medicine said: ""At some point, I believe we're going to be able to predict this disease in middle age, because that's when we can intervene [to lower a person's risk].

However, if and when we do develop such tests, society's willingness to take them up and use them will depend largely on how useful they are in terms of treating the disease.""","{""Nature Genetics"": 1}","{""Mike Owen"": 1}","{""Nature Genetics"": 1, ""Cardiff University's"": 1, ""School of Medicine"": 1}","{""Mike Owen"": 1}","{""Nature Genetics"": 1, ""Cardiff University's"": 1, ""School of Medicine"": 1}"

It takes the number of identified genes linked to Alzheimer's to 10 - the new genes affect three bodily processes and could become targets for treatment.

If the effects of all 10 could be eliminated the risk of developing the disease would be cut by 60%, research published in Nature Genetics says.

However, the international team warns new treatments could be 15 years away.

'Clueless' 

The disease is thought to be up to 80% genetic.

The first gene linked to the disease, APOE, was discovered more than 17 years ago but no new genes were discovered until 2009.

As Professor Kevin Morgan, from the University of Nottingham, put it: ""We were basically clueless.""

The newly discovered genes affect three processes in the body: the way it deals with fat and cholesterol; the mechanism by which brain cells process big molecules (endocytosis); and the immune system.

Cardiff University's Professor Julie Williams, who led the international study, said: ""What I find exciting is that we have found specific gene processes, we now have precise targets to identify treatments.""

She said that if the effect of these genes could be eliminated then the number of cases could be reduced by 60%.

""There are 500,000 people with Alzheimer's [in the UK] so if you could prevent 60% that would be 300,000 people,"" she said.

Ageing population 

Prof Morgan said: ""This disease is devastating, people are desperate for any hope or advance. I've no doubt it will come, but the time frame is 10 to 15 years.""

The disease is a growing problem because of an ageing population.

The Alzheimer's Society predicts the number of people with dementia will reach one million by 2021. 

Health economists already believe the cost to the UK of dementia is £23bn every year.

Rebecca Wood, chief executive of Alzheimer's Research UK, which part-funded the study, said: ""These findings are a step towards defeating dementia.

If drugs or lifestyle changes could be devised to counter these genetic variations, more than 60 percent of Alzheimer's cases could be prevented, according to the researchers, whose work was published in the journal Nature Genetics on Sunday.

But those discoveries could be at least 15 years away, they said.

Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, a fatal brain disease that affects memory, thinking, behavior and the ability to handle daily activities.

It is increasingly placing a heavy burden on societies and economies across the world.

""We are beginning to piece together the jigsaw and gain new understanding,"" said Julie Williams from Cardiff University's Center for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics in Wales, who led the study.

""If we were able to remove the detrimental effects of these genes through treatments, we hope we can help reduce the proportion of people developing Alzheimer's in the long-term.""

The researchers said the genetic variants they found highlight specific differences in people who get Alzheimer's, including variations in the immune system, the ways the brain handles cholesterol and lipids as well as a process called endocytosis which removes toxic protein from the brain.

BIG BURDEN

Alzheimer's Disease International predicts that as populations age, dementia cases will almost double every 20 years to around 66 million in 2030 and 115 million in 2050, with much of that rise happening in poorer nations.

""What's exciting is the genes we now know of -- the five new ones, plus those previously identified -- are clustering in patterns,"" Williams said at a briefing in London.

Scientists suspect genes can explain 60 to 80 percent of the risk of late onset Alzheimer's, the kind that occurs with age.

To find these new gene variants, Williams and an international consortium of fellow researchers looked at data from 25,000 people with Alzheimer's disease and 45,000 healthy people who were used as ""controls.""

They found that common gene variants called ABCA7, EPHA1, CD33 and CD2AP and MS42A were linked with an increased risk of developing the disease.

""These five genes now show compelling evidence of association with Alzheimer's disease,"" she said.

Previous studies over the past few decades have established that gene variants known as CLU, PICALM, CRI, BIN1 and APOE are also linked to Alzheimer's risk.

13-11-012_reuters,2011-06-27,AIDS drugs can cause premature ageing: study,"LONDONA class of generic AIDS drugs often used to treat HIV in Africa and other poor regions can cause premature aging and lead to age-related illnesses such as heart disease and dementia, scientists said on Sunday.

In a study in the journal Nature Genetics, British researchers found that the drugs, known as nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, or NRTIs, damage DNA in the patient's mitochondria - the ""batteries"" that power cells.

The scientists said it was unlikely that newer cocktails of AIDS drugs made by firms like Gilead, Merck, Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline would inflict similar levels of damage, since they are thought to be less toxic to mitochondria. But more research is needed to be certain.

""It takes time for these side effects to become apparent, so there is a question mark about the future and whether or not the newer drugs will cause this problem,"" Patrick Chinnery of the Institute of Genetic Medicine at Newcastle University said in a telephone interview. ""They are probably less likely to, but we don't know because we haven't had time to see.""

The findings do however help explain why HIV-infected people treated with older antiretroviral AIDS drugs sometimes show advanced signs of frailty and diseases such as heart disease and dementia at an early age, the researchers said.

""The DNA in our mitochondria gets copied throughout our lifetimes and, as we age, naturally accumulates errors,"" said Chinnery, who led the study.

""We believe these HIV drugs accelerate the rate at which these errors build up. So over the space of, say, 10 years, a person's mitochondrial DNA may have accumulated the same amount of errors as a person who has naturally aged 20 or 30 years.""

NRTI drugs - the best known of which is AZT, also known as zidovudine and originally developed by GSK - were a big advance in HIV treatment when they first emerged in the late 1980s.

 They extended patients' lives and helped make HIV a manageable chronic disease rather than the death sentence it once was.

Concerns about toxicity of NRTIs, particularly with long-term use, mean the drugs are now less commonly used in wealthy countries where they have been replaced by newer more expensive combination AIDS drugs with fewer side-effects.

But in poorer countries, where access to cheaper generic medicines is often the only option for HIV patients to get treatment, NRTIs are still relatively widely used.

An estimated 33.3 million people worldwide had the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS in 2009, according to the latest United Nations data, and 22.5 million of those live in Africa.

""These drugs may not be perfect, but we must remember that when they were introduced they gave people an extra 10 or 20 years when they would otherwise have died,"" said Brendan Payne of Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, who also worked on the study.

""In Africa, where the HIV epidemic has hit hardest and where more expensive medications are not an option, they are an absolute necessity.""

For their study, Chinnery's team studied muscle cells from HIV-infected adults, some of whom had previously been given NRTIs. 

They found that patients who had been treated with NRTIs - even as long as 10 years previously - had damaged mitochondria similar to that of a healthy older person.

The researchers are now looking at ways to repair or stall some of the damage caused by the drugs and say they believe that focusing on exercise - which appears to have a beneficial effect on patients with mitochondrial diseases - may help.

Locally advanced prostate cancer is that which has spread just outside the prostate gland, but not to other parts of the body.

Owen Sharp, chief executive of The Prostate Cancer Charity, said: ""This is the first research evidence to demonstrate these benefits to men clearly.

04-11-018_reuters,2011-11-03,Adding radiotherapy boosts prostate cancer survival,"Adding radiotherapy to hormone drugs for prostate cancer patients significantly improves survival compared with hormone treatment alone, and the combination could save many lives if it were made standard practice, scientists said Thursday.

In a study of men with prostate cancer -- the second most common form of cancer among men worldwide -- researchers found that 74 percent of those given radiotherapy plus hormone treatment were still alive after seven years.

This compared with 66 percent who got hormone drugs but did not receive radiotherapy, the researchers said.

The results of this trial are extremely encouraging,"" said Matthew Sydes, senior scientist at Britain's Medical Research Council's Clinical Trials Unit, which helped conduct the study.

He said the additional side-effects of radiotherapy are ""minimal,"" suggesting doctors could be confident in recommending the combination treatment for their patients.

After lung cancer, prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide and kills an estimated 255,000 men a year.

This study, conducted between 1995 and 2005, involved more than 1,200, men mostly from Britain and Canada, who had been diagnosed with locally advanced prostate cancer which had grown outside the surface of the prostate but had not spread further.

Half the men were treated with hormone drugs called androgen deprivation therapy, a standard form of treatment in this type of cancer, and the rest were treated with the same hormone therapy plus a course of radiotherapy.

The results were published in the Lancet medical journal.

""The trial has shown that radiotherapy is extremely worthwhile for patients with prostate cancer that is locally advanced,"" said Malcolm Mason from Cardiff University, who worked on the study with the trial's lead researcher, Padraig Warde of Toronto's University Health Network.

05-11-025_express,2011-09-09,'Fat genes' drug could wage war on obesity,"THE discovery of fat genes that make some pile on the pounds while others stay slim could be the latest weapon in the fight against obesity, it was revealed yesterday. 

Researchers at the University of Edinburgh have identi-fied genes in mice that encourage fat storage and prevent its breakdown, regardless of diet.

They think humans could carry identical or similar genes, which could be why some struggle to lose weight despite eating healthily.

It is hoped the breakthrough will lead to medication that can be used to help overweight people fight the flab without making lifestyle changes.

Until now genes involved in weight gain have been found to affect appetite. But latest research shows they could alter the metabolism and fat storage whatever food is consumed.

Appetite Dr Nik Morton, who led the research, said: ""We think humans could carry similar genes or at least that the same process could be going on in humans.

""We have known for a long time that there's a strong genetic component to being overweight and studies have shown genes can control appetite.

""Our research suggests genes in fat tissue determine the breakdown or putting down of fat regardless of diet."" He added: ""The next step would be to do more research on humans.""

The team compared fat tissue taken from mice which had been bred to be thin and compared it with tissue from mice bred to be fat. They pinpointed genes that prevented the breakdown of fat were present in overweight mice in greater numbers compared with thin ones.

By breeding fat and thin mice together they found the gene was passed on, with offspring that were born overweight carrying the same genetic make up as their ""fatter"" parent.

Dr Norton said: ""Again this supports the theory that obesity is something that can be hereditary, with people having overweight parents more likely to be obese themselves.""

The team also discovered that the genes led to weight gain in mice that were fed the same diet as those that stayed thin.

""If we can figure out the genes that control fat deposit and fat breakdown, we can go on to develop medicines that can help prevent obesity,"" said Dr Morton. He said this was the first time this specific set of ""fat genes"", which affect how fat is broken down or stored, had been found in fat tissue.

But he added: ""While this supports the idea that genetic factors are linked to obesity, exercise and diet are still important to maintain healthy lifestyles and can prevent most people from becoming obese.""

The research has been welcomed by the National Obesity Forum, which supports the theory that genes play a large role in obesity.

Its spokesman Tam Fry said: ""Genetics used to be considered an excuse but research has really shown that genes play a far higher role in obesity.

Researchers analysed the protein that triggers the debilitating reactions to dust, pollen, pets and food and identified ways of targeting it more efficiently.

Using an X-ray beam 100 billion times stronger than normal, they got a 3D picture of the shape of H1 receptors - the protein drugs protect from allergy-causing histamines.

But today's medicines can spark side effects from drowsiness, dizziness to dry throats and irregular heartbeat. Lead researcher Dr Simone Weyand said new images of H1, taken by the Diamond Synchrotron near Oxford, gave experts a much clearer picture of its make up.

She told the journal Nature: ""It is a big, exciting result. In an allergy we produce histamine which binds to H1. Drugs stop that but also have lots of side effects. Now we know which part of the receptor is interacting with the drug so we can design and develop more targeted treatments.

08-11-010_bbcnews,2011-04-05,Chemical found which 'makes bone marrow repair skin',"The chemical which summons stem cells from bone marrow to the site of a wound has been discovered by scientists in the UK and Japan.

The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, identified the distress signal - HMGB1.

The authors believe it can be used to put ""a megaphone in the system"" to improve the treatment of injuries such as burns and leg ulcers.

Another UK expert said the research had potential.

Bone marrow was thought to play a role in repairing damaged skin, but the exact process was unknown.

Scientists at Osaka University and King's College London gave mice bone marrow cells that glow green - which can be tracked while moving round the body.

They then wounded the mice and some were given skin grafts. 

Megaphone medicine 

In mice without grafts, very few stem cells travelled to the wound.

Those with grafts had many stem cells travelling to the wound.

Professor John McGrath, from King's College London, says grafted skin tissue has no blood vessels and therefore no oxygen.

He says this environment leads to the release of HMGB1 - or what he called a 'Save Our Skin signal' - which results in stem cells moving to the wound.

He said: ""It could have a very big impact on regenerative medicine for treating people with rare genetic illnesses and more common problems such as burns and ulcers.

""It could potentially revolutionise the management of wound healing.""

He envisaged treatments in which a drug similar to HMGB1 would be injected near to a wound.

He said: ""It would be like putting a megaphone in the system"" bringing stem cells to the injury.

Researchers in Osaka are developing a drug to mimic HMGB1.

They hope to begin animal testing by the end of the year and human clinical trials shortly afterwards.

Phil Stephens, professor of Cell Biology at Cardiff University, said: ""I think it has potentially big clinical implications, but the key is potential if you can control it.

You can't just chuck it on, you need the right amounts at the right time.""

06-11-014_dailymail,2011-06-22,High doses of statins could increase risk of diabetes,"High doses of cholesterol-lowering pills can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, researchers warn.

They have found that patients taking intensive courses of statins were 12 per cent more likely to get the disease.

But experts pointed out that that the risk was far outweighed by the substantial benefits – the pills were shown to reduce the likelihood of heart attacks by 16 per cent.

More than seven million people in Britain now take statins - as many as one in three adults over the age of 40.

It is not known exactly how many are on high doses of more than 80 miligrams a day, but it is likely to only be a small proportion most at risk of heart attacks and strokes.

Researchers from the University of Glasgow looked at five previous studies involving 32,700 patients.

They were either on high doses of 80 mg or moderate doses of 20mg to 40 mg.

The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found there were 149 extra cases of type 2 diabetes recorded amongst the patients on high dose statins, representing a 12 per cent risk.

The authors concluded: 'Our findings suggest that clinicians should be vigilant for the development of diabetes in patients receiving intensive statin therapy.' 

Statins are extremely effective in lowering levels of cholesterol, the fatty substance in the blood that clogs up arteries leading to heart attacks and strokes.

Last night experts urged people not to stop taking the pills on the basis on this evidence.

Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director of the British Heart Foundation, said: 'Nobody should stop taking their prescribed statins because of the evidence shown in this research.

'Statins play a vital role in protecting the hearts of many, many people and the benefits still far outweigh any risks associated with diabetes.

'The increased risk occurred predominantly in those taking a high dose of these drugs, whereas most people are on low or moderate doses.

'Always speak to your doctor if you have any concerns about your medication. Don’t simply stop taking it.' 

Experts also pointed out that patients on statins may have been at higher risk of diabetes in the first place if they were overweight.

Libby Dowling, clinical advisor at Diabetes UK said: 'This analysis of previous studies has found that high doses of statins increase the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, yet at the same time reduce the risk of heart disease.

'What we don’t know from this research is whether the people being prescribed the high-dose statins were overweight as having a large waist puts you at increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes anyway.","{""Journal of the American Medical Association"": 1}","{""Peter Weissberg"": 1, ""Libby Dowling"": 1}","{""the University of Glasgow"": 1, ""the Journal of the American Medical Association"": 1, ""the British Heart Foundation"": 1, ""Diabetes UK"": 1}",,"{""the University of Glasgow"": 1, ""the British Heart Foundation"": 1, ""Diabetes UK"": 1}"
06-11-014_express,2011-06-22,Cheaper statins on NHS can put patients in danger,"MILLIONS of NHS patients are being prescribed a cut-price cholesterol-busting statin less effective than more expensive treatments.

Research reveals a pricier version slashes the risk of a heart attack or stroke by 19 per cent more than the statin recommended by the drug rationing body.

British researchers from St George's, University of London, and colleagues at the University of Glasgow, found that simvastatin recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence does not protect against coronary events as effectively as the alternative drug atorvastatin among patients taking high doses.

Simvastatin has also been shown to dramatically increase the risk of severe muscle damage.

The study also revealed that intensive doses of widely-prescribed statins increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes by 12 per cent.

But this was balanced by the high-dose patients also seeing a 16 per cent reduced risk of cardiovascular events.

The diabetes risk posed to overall health is low, especially when compared to the benefi-cial effects statins have on reducing the risk of serious heart problems.

More than six million in Britain take statins, usually a 40mg dose, to reduce their ""bad"" cholesterol and slash chances of a heart attack.

Left unchecked, the cholesterol can build up fatty deposits in the arteries and lead to coronary heart disease, heart attacks and stroke.

There has been evidence of severe side-effects from higher doses of 80mg, ranging from muscle aches and stomach upsets to a rare but serious lung disorder, cataracts, liver damage and kidney failure.

The research calls on Nice to recommend the more expensive pill instead. A 28-day course of simvastatin given to patients on 80mg costs around £2.30 compared with a 28-day course of atorvastatin which costs about £28.

Researcher Professor Kausik Ray from St George's said: ""Statins are related to an increase in diabetes risk. Patients on high doses should continue and complement it with more regular screening for diabetes.

""Nice recommends simvastatin 80mg as it is the least expensive option in patients with established heart disease. However, this research shows that it is not the best option.

""There are people who are going to need high-dose statin therapy. Is £22 cheaper a price worth paying for a drug less effective at cholesterol lowering, has the same diabetes risk and has a 2000 per cent increase risk of severe muscle damage? It doesn't make sense.""

WHAT THE DRUG DOES 

? STATINS are drugs commonly used to reduce cholesterol levels in the blood.

? They include atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin and cheapest type, simvastatin.

? Statins are already taken by around six million people in Britain.

? They work by blocking the action of the chemical in the liver needed to make cholesterol.

? They can reduce harmful cholesterol by more than 20 per cent and the risk of dying from heart disease by around 25 per cent.

06-11-014_independent,2011-06-26,High dose of anti-cholesterol drugs linked to diabetes,"High doses of drugs aimed at lowering cholesterol are linked to increasing numbers of new diabetes cases in patients, said a review of multiple studies on the topic published Tuesday.

However, those same high doses helped dramatically lower the incidence of cardiovascular problems in patients, leaving doctors to balance the benefits and risks according to each individual patient.

The meta-analysis compared high and moderate doses of the anti-cholesterol drugs known as statins, in five randomized clinical trials on 32,752 people, and was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Over an average follow-up period of nearly five years, 8.4 percent of the patients developed diabetes - 1,449 in the intensive-dose category and 1,300 in the moderate dose group - a total of 149 more in the higher dose group.

But when the researchers examined how many patients had major cardiovascular problems after therapy, they found the higher dose statin group had 416 fewer such events (3,134 in the intensive group and 3,550 in the moderate one).

""Our findings suggest that clinicians should be vigilant for the development of diabetes in patients receiving intensive statin therapy,"" said the study, led by David Preiss of the University of Glasgow.

""Given the cardiovascular benefits of statins and the likely increasing use of intensive statin regimens, it is important to quantify any potential long-term risks to enable physicians and patients to make informed choices.""

Statins - which include popularly known names such as Lipitor, Pravachol, and Crestor - are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the United States.

 About 42 million Americans suffer from high cholesterol.

The drugs help reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke by lowering a person's low-density lipoprotein (LDL), sometimes known as ""bad cholesterol.""

Earlier this month, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about high doses of the cholesterol-lowering medication simvastatin (Zocor, Vytorin, Simcor) because of an elevated risk of muscle injury associated with the 80 milligram dose, particularly in the first year of treatment.","{""Journal of the American Medical Association"": 1}","{""David Preiss"": 1}","{""the Journal of the American Medical Association"": 1, ""the University of Glasgow"": 1, ""Lipitor"": 1, ""Pravachol"": 1, ""Crestor"": 1, ""the US Food and Drug Administration"": 1}","{""David Preiss"": 1}","{""the University of Glasgow"": 1}"
06-11-001_dailymail,2011-01-05,ONE-MINUTE TEST TO TELL A MOTHER HER IVF CHANCES ONE-MINUTE TEST TO TELL A WOMAN HER IVF CHANCES,"A 60-SECOND test which predicts couples' chances of having a baby through IVF has been created by scientists.

The free calculator, which is available online, uses the answers to nine simple questions to work out the odds of fertility treatment succeeding.

With the results said to be almost 100 per cent accurate, the test could save couples the emotional and financial pain of going through repeated treatments only for them to fail.

Women with a lower likelihood of becoming mothers could be told early on about tweaks to the their treatment that could increase their chances.

Others could be counselled to think about alternative options such as adoption.

Glasgow and Bristol university researchers obtained background information on almost 150,000 IVF treatments carried out in the UK between 2003 and 2007.

They used this to work out which factors were most important in becoming pregnant. From this, they created the IVFpredict test.

The nine questions take as little as a minute to answer in total and the results are up to 99 per cent accurate, the scientists say.

This is despite them not including information about lifestyle factors such as smoking and weight.

Those given low odds may be able to increase their chances as much as three-fold by opting for donor eggs or ICSI, in which sperm is injected directly into the egg, the journal PLoS ONE reports.

Professor Scott Nelson, a researcher from Glasgow University, said: 'The test provides critical information on the likely outcome for couples deciding whether to undergo IVF Ð up until now estimates of success have not been reliable.

'Not every attempt at IVF is successful. 

In the U.S. and the UK, IVF is successful in about a third of women under 35 years old but in only 5 to 10 per cent of women over 40.

'However, there are many other factors in addition to age which can alter your chance of success and clinics don't usually take these into account when counselling couples or women.' 

Fertility treatment can cost between £3,000 and £15,000 per course. But fewer than one in four IVF treatments leads to a birth.

Although other calculators exist, they are either less accurate or involve such intricate data about subjects such as hormone levels that they can only been done in a doctor's surgery.

Debbie Lawlor, professor of epidemiology at the University of Bristol, said: 'The IVF calculator is not only of use to the couples themselves but also to health care funders such as the NHS to ensure appropriate use of resources.

'The sheer scale of the data we analysed is the key to the accuracy of this model. The more data you look at, the more accurate the predictions become.'

But Professor Bill Ledger, a leading fertility doctor and member of the fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, urged caution.

He said: 'While the test will give an individual some idea of their chances, it is not much use unless put alongside data from the clinic the woman attends.'

IVF (in-vitro fertilisation) is expensive, only sometimes available on the NHS and less successful than many people think.

To help couples to decide whether IVF is worth pursuing for them, academics at Glasgow and Bristol have created the calculator, which they say will predict a woman's likelihood of giving birth with up to 99% accuracy.

""IVF is successful in about a third of women under 35 years old, but in only 5%-10% of women over the age of 40,"" said Professor Scott Nelson, Muirhead chair of reproductive and maternal medicine at the University of Glasgow.

""However, there are many other factors in addition to age which can alter your chance of success, and clinics don't usually take these into account when counselling couples or women.""

The calculator, available for free at ivfpredict.com, is based on data from more than 144,000 IVF cycles held by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) - all the outcomes of treatments undergone between 2003 and 2007.

""Essentially, these findings indicate that treatment-specific factors can be used to provide infertile couples with a very accurate assessment of their chance of a successful outcome following IVF,"" Nelson said. 

""It provides critical information on the likely outcome for couples deciding whether to undergo IVF. Up until now, estimates of success have not been reliable.""

Debbie Lawlor, professor of epidemiology at the University of Bristol, said the calculator would be of use not only to couples but also to ""healthcare funders like the NHS to ensure appropriate use of resources"". 

It raises the possibility that GP consortia could turn couples down for NHS treatment on the basis that their chances of success are too low.

The findings, which are published in the Public Library of Science, were welcomed by Professor Gordon Smith, head of the department of obstetrics and gynaecology at Cambridge University.

""There is a real need in medicine to try to replace general statements such as 'high risk' and 'good chance' with well validated, quantitative estimates of probability, such as we have with Down's syndrome screening,"" he said.

09-11-013_express,2011-10-20,Scottish researchers make breakthrough in preventing strokes,"SCIENTISTS have moved a step closer to preventing fatal strokes after discovering how to trigger a built-in defence mechanism in the brain.

Researchers from Edinburgh and Dundee have identified a protein that enables the brain to keep functioning when it is starved of its blood supply.

The scientists now hope the AMPK protein can be harnessed to protect at-risk patients from suffering permanent brain damage or death if they suffer a stroke.

AMPK is produced naturally to enable the brain to keep functioning when supplies of oxygen and glucose are restricted as blood vessels are damaged.

Drugs that trigger the production of AMPK are already in use to treat conditions such as liver disease, but now researchers are examining ways of using it to trigger the brain's ""defensive process"" during strokes, which are caused when the blood supply to parts of the brain become blocked.

AMPK was first discovered by Professor Graham Hardie of the University of Dundee, who worked in a team with researchers from the Universities of Edinburgh and Leeds.

He said: ""There are drugs currently on the market that stimulate AMPK, which are used to treat other conditions.

""In future these and other drugs could be given to at-risk patients to give them a better chance of surviving a stroke.""

The discovery was yesterday welcomed by health experts, who said that it could eventually lead to a drastic reduction in people being left severely disabled by strokes.

Dr Sharlin Ahmed, research liaison officer at The Stroke Association, said: ""When a stroke occurs, the brain is starved of oxygen causing brain cells to become damaged or die.

This study suggests that brain cells could in fact have the potential to naturally protect themselves when the blood supply is cut off if a certain defensive process is triggered.

""The findings could help us to understand how we can protect brain cells when a stroke strikes, which could reduce the level of disability that many stroke survivors are left with.""

AMPK works by making the brain operate more slowly when it is deprived of its blood flow, protecting nerves against the effects of depleted oxygen supply.

Mark Evans, professor of cellular pharmacology at the University of Edinburgh led the research.

He said: ""Our findings suggest that if brain cells run short of energy, they start to work more slowly.

""But it is better to work slowly than not at all.""

Strokes are the greatest single cause of severe disability in Scotland and the third most common cause of death.

18-11-005_bbcnews,2011-04-18,Mother's diet during pregnancy alters baby's DNA,"A mother's diet during pregnancy can alter the DNA of her child and increase the risk of obesity, according to researchers.

The study, to be published in the journal Diabetes, showed that eating low levels of carbohydrate changed bits of DNA.

It then showed children with these changes were fatter.

The British Heart Foundation called for better nutritional and lifestyle support for women.

It is thought that a developing baby tries to predict the environment it will be born into, taking cues from its mother and adjusting its DNA.

Epigenetics 

Studies in animals have shown that changes in diet can alter the function of genes - known as epigenetic change. 

It is a growing field trying to understand how the environment interacts with genes.

In this study, the researchers took samples from the umbilical cord and looked for ""epigenetic markers"".

They showed that mothers with early pregnancy diets low in carbohydrates, such as sugars and starch, had children with these markers.

They then showed a strong link between those same markers and a child's obesity at ages six and nine.

Professor Keith Godfrey, who is from the University of Southampton and led the international study, told the BBC: ""What is surprising is that it explains a quarter of the difference in the fatness of children six to nine years later.""

The report says the effect was ""considerably greater"" than that of birth weight and did not depend on how thin or fat the mother was.

The changes were noticed in the RXRA gene.

 This makes a receptor for vitamin A, which is involved in the way cells process fat. 

Professor Godfrey said: ""It is both a fascinating and potentially important piece of research.

""All women who become pregnant get advice about diet, but it is not always high up the agenda of health professionals.

""The research suggests women should follow the advice as it may have a long term influence on the baby's health after it is born."" 

Professor Mark Hanson, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ""This study provides compelling evidence that epigenetic changes, at least in part, explain the link between a poor start to life and later disease risk.

""It strengthens the case for all women of reproductive age having greater access to nutritional, education and lifestyle support to improve the health of the next generation, and to reduce the risk of the conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, which often follow obesity.""","{""Diabetes"": 1}","{""Keith Godfrey"": 1, ""Godfrey"": 1, ""Mark Hanson"": 1}","{""The British Heart Foundation"": 1, ""the University of Southampton"": 1, ""BBC"": 1, ""RXRA"": 1, ""the British Heart Foundation"": 1}","{""Keith Godfrey"": 1, ""Godfrey"": 2, ""Mark Hanson"": 1}","{""The British Heart Foundation"": 1, ""the University of Southampton"": 1, ""BBC"": 1, ""the British Heart Foundation"": 1}"
02-11-012_telegraph,2011-03-03,"Miscarriage trauma 'persists after successful birth'

The trauma of miscarriage does not end with a healthy baby, but continues for up to three years after a successful birth, a study has found.","Up to a fifth of pregnancies end in miscarriage while 0.5 per cent result in stillbirth. 

A common perception is that women overcome their psychological effects with the subsequent birth of a healthy child. 

But an analysis of 13,000 British women, found that the 2,800 who had suffered a miscarriage or stillbirth were much more likely to be anxious or depressed during their next pregnancy - and after the birth. 

This state of mind persisted for nearly three years after they gave birth to a healthy baby, found researchers. 

The findings are published today (THUR) online in the British Journal of Psychiatry. 

The women were drawn from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), which follows 14,000 women in the Bristol area who were pregnant in 1991 and 1992. 

Professor Jean Golding, founder of ALSPAC and one of the report's authors, said: ""This study is important to the families of women who have lost a baby, since it is so often assumed that they get over the event quickly, yet as shown here, many do not. 

""This has implications for the medical profession as well as the woman and her family."" 

Dr Emma Robertson Blackmore of Rochester University in the US, who led the study, said: ""This finding is important because, when assessing if a women is at risk of antenatal or postnatal depression, previous pregnancy loss is usually not taken into account in the same way as other risk factors such as a family history of depression, stressful life events or a lack of social support."" 

Miscarriage is defined as the loss of a baby before 24 weeks and stillbirth the loss after 24 weeks. 

Between 50 and 80 per cent of women who experience pregnancy loss become pregnant again. 

Louise Silverton, deputy general secretary of the Royal College of Midwives, said the study ""underlines the need for midwives to be able to spend time with women to discuss their pregnancy and their worries and fears"".","{""British Journal of Psychiatry"": 1}","{""Jean Golding"": 1, ""Emma Robertson"": 1, ""Blackmore"": 1, ""Louise Silverton"": 1}","{""the British Journal of Psychiatry"": 1, ""the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)"": 1, ""ALSPAC"": 1, ""Rochester University"": 1, ""the Royal College of Midwives"": 1}","{""Jean Golding"": 1, ""Emma Robertson"": 1, ""Blackmore"": 1}","{""the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)"": 1, ""ALSPAC"": 1, ""Rochester University"": 1, ""the Royal College of Midwives"": 1}"

14-11-006_dailymail,2011-01-31,FREE MORNING-AFTER PILL FAILS TO CUT UNDERAGE PREGNANCIES,"THE drive to give free morning-after pills to teenage girls has failed to cut underage pregnancies.

Schemes to offer over-the-counter emergency birth control to girls under 16 have simply encouraged youngsters to have more unprotected sex, damning research found.

In doing so they have fuelled a rise in sexually transmitted diseases.

The findings are a blow to public health chiefs who have argued that handing out the morning-after pill cuts schoolgirl pregnancies.

Family campaigners seized on the research as more evidence that the problem of teenage pregnancies needs a 'moral solution' and not one based on dishing out drugs.

Britain has the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Western Europe.

In 2008, the last year for which figures are available, more than 7,500 girls in England and Wales became pregnant.

The scheme to give free emergency contraception to teenagers Z including girls under 16 Z in pharmacies was a key part of the last government's Teenage Pregnancy Strategy.

But the research from Nottingham University's business school shows the policy has failed.

Economists Professor David Paton and Professor Sourafel Girma compared pregnancy rates and levels of sexually transmitted infections in more than 140 local authorities across England between 1998 and 2004.

Some of the authorities did not offer free over-the-counter morning after pills to teenagers, while others introduced the scheme part way through the study period.

Pregnancy rates among girls under-16 were the same whether or not they had access to free morning after pills from chemists, the researchers found.

However, the rates of sexually transmitted disease were significantly higher in areas taking part in the scheme.

The same findings were true for girls aged 16 to 18.

Professor Paton said: 'Offering the morning-after pill free of charge didn't have the intended effect of cutting teenage pregnancies, but did have the unfortunate side effect of increasing sexually transmitted infections.

'Almost certainly young people are having more unprotected sex.'

The findings have serious implications for health chiefs.

'If these schemes which local authorities are spending money on are not having a good effect, but having a negative unintended consequence, the implication is that this money should be spent elsewhere,' he said.

The study, which is due to be published by the Journal of Health Economics, took into account lifestyle factors that might influence disease and pregnancy rates in different parts of England.

It found that sexually transmitted infections increased by 12 per cent among the under 16s where the morning-after pill was available free from chemists.

Tory MP Julian Brazier said: 'This is just more evidence that Labour's health establishment trying to find purely mechanical solutions to problems which need moral solutions.

The fact Britain leads the developing world in children born to young unmarried mothers is a moral problem, and not a chemical one.'

Norman Wells, of the Family Education Trust, said: 'International research has consistently failed to find any evidence that emergency birth control schemes achieve a reduction in teenage conception an abortion rates.

'But now we have evidence showing that not only are such schemes failing to do any good, they may in fact be doing harm.'

Rates of sexually transmitted disease are soaring in the UK.

In 2009 there were nearly half a million new cases.

The number of people with chlamydia has trebled since 1998.

Labour's Teenage Pregnancy Strategy was supposed to halve under-18 pregnancy rates in England by 2010

. But despite costing 6246 million, it came nowhere near the target.

A Department of Health spokesman said: 'We have one of the worst teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection rates in Western Europe.

'We need a bold new approach to tackling these issues because so many of the lifestyle driven health problems are already at alarming levels.

'That is why the Government wasted no time in publishing a strategy for public health.

It sets out our plans to ring-fence public health spending, devolve power and budgets to local communities and work across areas from housing to education to improve public health.'","{""Journal of Health Economics"": 1}","{""David Paton"": 1, ""Sourafel Girma"": 1, ""Paton"": 1, ""Julian"": 1, ""Brazier"": 1, ""Norman Wells"": 1}","{""Teenage Pregnancy Strategy"": 2, ""Nottingham University's"": 1, ""the Journal of Health Economics"": 1, ""Labour"": 2, ""the Family Education Trust"": 1, ""Department of Health"": 1, ""Government"": 1}","{""David Paton"": 1, ""Sourafel Girma"": 1, ""Paton"": 2}","{""Nottingham University's"": 1, ""the Journal of Health Economics"": 1, ""Labour"": 1, ""the Family Education Trust"": 1, ""Department of Health"": 1}"

A study has found that the policy encouraged young people to have unprotected sex and failed to reduce the number of under-age pregnancies.

Professors Sourafel Girma and David Paton of Nottingham University compared areas of England where the scheme was introduced with areas where it was not implemented.

They found that pregnancy rates for girls aged under 16 remained the same, while the rates of sexually transmitted diseases increased by 12 per cent in those areas where the pill was available free from chemists.

Prof Paton said: ""We find that offering the morning-after pill free of charge didn't have the intended effect of cutting teenage pregnancies but did have the unfortunate side effect of increasing sexually transmitted infections.

""By focusing on sexually transmitted infections it allows us to test whether there is an impact on sexual risk-taking, and that seems to be the implication.""

The report, The Impact of Emergency Birth Control on Teen Pregnancy and STIs, will be published in the Journal of Health Economics.

The Government is expected to overhaul it teenage pregnancy strategy.

Teenage pregnancy rates in Britain are the highest in western Europe and the number of sexual diseases diagnosed in under 16s has risen by 58 per cent in five years, with chlamydia now most common.

Norman Wells, director of the Family Education Trust, said: ""International research has consistently failed to find any evidence that emergency birth control schemes achieve a reduction in teenage conception and abortion rates.

14-11-006_sundaytimes,2011-01-30,Pill handout causes rise in teen sex disease,"AN official scheme to give the morning-after pill free to teenagers at chemists has backfired by increasing the rates of sexually transmitted diseases and failing to reduce the number of under-age pregnancies.

New research shows the Department of Health's policy of handing out emergency contraception to under-16s encourages them to indulge in riskier sex lives.

Offering the morning-after pill to adolescents has been a major part of governments' teenage pregnancy strategy over the past 10 years.

The policy was intended to cut record levels of schoolgirls having babies by giving them medication, taken up to three days after unprotected sex, to end the pregnancy.

The government now intends to overhaul its whole approach to teenage pregnancy.

The new study, by professors Sourafel Girma and David Paton, of Nottingham University, compared areas of England where the scheme was introduced with others that either declined to provide the morning-after pill free from pharmacies or did so at a later date.

The academics found the rates of pregnancy among girls under 16 remained the same, but the rates of sexually transmitted infections increased.

Paton said: ""We find that offering the morning-after pill free of charge didn't have the intended effect of cutting teenage pregnancies but did have the unfortunate side effect of increasing sexually transmitted infections.

""By focusing on sexually transmitted infections, it allows us to test whether there is an impact on sexual risk-taking, and that seems to be the implication.""

The report, to be published in the Journal of Health Economics, found that sexually transmitted infections increased by 12% among the under-16s where the morning-after pill was available free from chemists.

Britain has the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in western Europe.

In 2008, the latest year for which figures are available, more than 7,500 girls in England and Wales became pregnant.

Nearly two thirds of these pregnancies ended in abortion.

Rates of sexually transmitted diseases are rising in Britain.

In 2009 there were 12,000 more cases than the previous year, when 470,701 cases were reported.

The number of infections in 16- to 19 year-olds seen at genito-urinary medicine clinics rose from 46,856 in 2003 to 58,133 in 2007.

Norman Wells, director of the Family Eduction Trust, said: ""International research has consistently failed to find any evidence that emergency birth control schemes achieve a reduction in teenage conception and abortion rates.

Dr Michalis Samarkos has not stopped working since he started his shift some 14 hours earlier, and he has been besieged by patients unable to afford the tests or the drugs they need.

Many, like the unemployed diabetic man he has just examined, have gone without treatment for several days.

""When you see a diabetic unable to afford his insulin you know he is going to die,"" said Samarkos.

""There is no infrastructure to help these people.

On every front the system has failed the people it was meant to serve.""

Greeks are paying for their economic disaster with their health, according to a new study published today.

In a letter to the Lancet medical journal, a team lead by Dr Alexander Kentikelenis and Dr David Stuckler from Cambridge University and Professor Martin McKee from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine warns of a potential ""Greek tragedy"".

They point to signs of a dramatic decline in the health of the population and a deterioration of services at hospitals under financial pressure.

Many Greeks have lost access to healthcare coverage through work and social security plans, and increased poverty means growing numbers who would have used the private sector are now attending state hospitals.

Alongside savage spending cuts, the rise has put an immense strain on a chaotic and corrupt system that was already in decline.

Hospital budgets fell by 40% between 2007 and 2009, say the Lancet authors.

There are reports of understaffing, shortages of medical supplies and patients bribing medical staff to jump queues.

""There are signs that health outcomes have worsened, especially in vulnerable groups,"" write the experts.

There was a 14% rise in the number of Greeks reporting their health as ""bad"" or ""very bad"" between 2007 and 2009.

Suicides rose by 17% during the same period, and unofficial 2010 data quoted in parliament mention a 25% rise compared with 2009.

The health minister reported a 40% rise in the first half of 2011 compared with the same period in 2010.

""The national suicide helpline reported that 25% of callers faced financial difficulties in 2010 and reports in the media indicate that the inability to repay high levels of personal debt might be a key factor in the increase in suicides,"" the Lancet authors write.

""Violence has also risen, and homicide and theft rates nearly doubled between 2007 and 2009.""

Their analysis is based on data from the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions.

Pressure on health services may account for a rise of 15% between 2007 and 2009 in the numbers who say they did not see a doctor though they thought they should.

Long waiting times and travel distances to clinics were among reasons cited.

GP and hospital outpatient care is virtually free, but many Greeks cannot even afford the euros 5 (£4.30) fee they are required to pay when visiting public outpatient clinics, and doctors say they are often forced to haggle over fees.

Meanwhile, there has been a marked rise in the number of people admitted to hospital - up 24% between 2009 and 2010 and up another 8% in the first half of 2011 compared with the same period last year.

The impact of cuts on drugs services appears particularly troubling. HIV infections rose significantly in 2010, with injecting drug users accounting for half of the rise.

The numbers are on course to rise by 52% this year.

Many new infections are linked to rises in prostitution and unsafe sex.

Heroin use reportedly rose by 20% in 2009, according to estimates from the Greek Documentation and Monitoring Centre for Drugs.

Budget cuts in 2009 and 2010 have meant the loss of a third of the country's outreach programmes.

""Overall, the picture of health in Greece is concerning,"" write the Lancet authors.

""In an effort to finance debts, ordinary people are paying the ultimate price: losing access to care and preventive services, facing higher risks of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, and in the worst cases losing their lives.

03-11-036_reuters,2011-10-10,Sick Greek economy takes heavy toll on health,"Greece's debt crisis is hitting the health of the nation hard, with the number of suicides increasing, more people turning to drugs and prostitution and rapidly rising rates of HIV infections, researchers said on Monday.

Swingeing budget cuts and growing unemployment are pushing more people into severe depression and drug-dependence, and cutbacks in hospital budgets and healthcare services mean fewer people can see their doctors or access help.

""The picture of health in Greece is concerning,"" said David Stuckler, a sociologist at Britain's University of Cambridge who reported his findings in the Lancet medical journal.

""We're seeing ... worrisome trends -- a doubling of suicides, rising homicides, a 50 percent rise in HIV infections and people reporting that their health has got worse but they're not going to the doctor even though they felt they needed to.""

In the past two years, the Greek government has imposed harsh austerity measures to deal with a debt mountain as the country plummeted into its deepest recession in 40 years and was forced to accept an EU-IMF bailout.

Greece is expected to run out of cash as soon as mid-November. Inspectors from the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank -- the so-called ""troika"" -- are currently assessing whether Athens has fulfilled the criteria for more aid.

In the meantime, businesses are shutting down, the public sector is shrinking and unemployment is running at more than 16 percent.

Health budget cuts have also led Greece to slash the prices it will pay for medicines, triggering supply concerns.

Stuckler's team found that suicides rose by 17 percent in 2009 from 2007 and said unofficial data quoted in Greece's parliament point to even greater rises, of 25 to 40 percent.

The data mirror grim local news reports.

In tales that have shocked Athenians, a former businessman was reported to have jumped to his death leaving a note saying the financial crisis drove him to it, and the owner of a small retail firm was found hanging from rope tied to a bridge.

His suicide note said simply: ""Don't look for other reasons.

The economic crisis led me to this.""

LESSON TO OTHERS

Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who worked with Stuckler on the Lancet paper, said other struggling European nations should take note.

""The experience of Greece is a warning of what can happen if there are major cuts to healthcare in the face of a recession,"" he said in a telephone interview.

A previous study by McKee, Stuckler and others in July found suicide rates across Europe rose sharply in the two years to 2009 as the financial crisis drove unemployment up and squeezed incomes. Greece and Ireland were worst hit.

In Monday's paper, the researchers also found a significant increase in HIV infections in Greece in late 2010 and said data suggest that new infections with the virus that causes AIDS will rise by 52 percent this year compared to last.

Rates of heroin use rose by 20 percent in 2009, and at the same time, budget cuts in 2009 and 2010 meant a loss of a third of the country's street-work programs designed to help drug addicts and provide them with HIV prevention services.

Stuckler said there were reports of some drug users deliberately infecting themselves with HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, to get access to welfare benefits of 700 euros ($940) a month and faster admission into drug substitution programs.

""It's really alarming,"" he said.

Greece has had a rocky relationship with pharmaceutical companies as a result of the crisis, imposing some of the most draconian price cuts for medicines of any European country, with unpaid bills a further burden for pharmaceutical companies.

Swiss group Roche has stopped delivering cancer drugs to some state-funded Greek hospitals that have not paid their bills, with patients being told to collect medicines from privately run pharmacies as they are more reliable payers.

Roche and other drugmakers have also been forced to accept Greek government bonds instead of cash for some outstanding debts -- a move that is expected to increase bad debt provisions, although Greece accounts for only around 1 percent of the global pharmaceuticals market.","{""Lancet medical journal"": 1}","{""David Stuckler"": 1, ""Martin McKee"": 1}","{""University of Cambridge"": 1, ""Lancet"": 2, ""EU"": 1, ""the European Union"": 1, ""the International Monetary Fund"": 1, ""the European Central Bank"": 1, ""Stuckler"": 3, ""the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"": 1, ""McKee, Stuckler"": 1, ""Roche"": 2}","{""David Stuckler"": 1, ""Martin McKee"": 1}","{""University of Cambridge"": 1, ""Lancet"": 2, ""Stuckler"": 2, ""EU"": 1, ""the European Union"": 1, ""the International Monetary Fund"": 1, ""the European Central Bank"": 1, ""the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"": 1, ""Roche"": 1}"
07-11-018_express,2011-05-26,DAILY PILL TO SAVE MILLIONS,"New miracle drug beats both cancer and heart disease

A NEW wonder pill that can halve the risk of heart disease and strokes will give hope to millions, a study claims today.

The single tablet, to be taken once a day, may also offer substantial protection against cancer.

Incredibly, the 'polypill', which combines aspirin, a statin, a blood pressure drug and a diuretic, could cost just 13p a day. 

In Britain alone, it could lead to twice as many patients being offered preventative treatment for heart problems, while around the globe it could save millions of lives.

Cardiovascular disease is one of the biggest killers in the UK, claiming almost 200,000 lives a year.

Although the best way to avoid heart disease is to adopt a healthy lifestyle, doctors can also prescribe statins to reduce cholesterol and blood pressure pills to help hypertension.

Some patients are also told to take aspirin to thin their blood, while a water pill - or diuretic - can prevent water retention.

However, many patients find it inconvenient and confusing having to take four different pills every day, often at different times, leading some not to bother at all. 

Now an international study suggests the new polypill - which could be available within two years - can offer the same benefits as the four separate drugs.

Importantly, the study also shows the four-in-one pill could increase the number of patients treated under current guidelines from five to ten per cent of the adult population.

Study leader Anthony Rodgers, professor of global health at the George Institute in Sydney, Australia, said: ""We have to change our horizons and the number of diseases we look at when assessing cardiovascular risk.

""The results show a halving in heart disease and stroke can be expected for people taking the polypill long term. 

We know from other trials that long term there would also be a 25 to 50 per cent lower death rate from colon cancer, plus reductions in other major cancers, heart failure and renal failure.

""These benefits would take several years to kick in but, of course, one of the hopes with a polypill is it helps people take medicines long-term.""

The latest study, published in the journal PLoS One, involved 378 patients from around the world.

All had an increased risk of heart problems but none were on medication because their individual readings for cholesterol or blood pressure were not high enough to qualify for medical intervention.

The study gave half of the participants the polypill for three months and the other half a dummy pill.

After 12 weeks, those who had taken the polypill had substantially reduced blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

The authors claim that within a few years of treatment the pill would halve the risk of heart disease or a stroke.

The polypill contains 75mg of aspirin, 10mg of the blood pressure agent lisinopril, 12.5mg of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, and 20mg of simvastatin, a cholesterol medicine.

Although aspirin can cause internal bleeding in some patients, the authors believe its role in preventing cancer outweighs such risks.

However, the study also showed that one in 20 patients suffered such bad side effects that they stopped taking the medication.

For this reason, the authors say the polypill should only be offered to patients at risk of heart disease rather than to everyone over a certain age.

Professor Simon Thom, of Imperial College London, who led the UK arm of the trial, said: ""We now need to conduct larger trials to test whether these medicines are best provided in the form of a polypill, or as separate medicines.""

Last night, charities welcomed the report but said larger studies were needed.

07-11-018_guardian,2011-05-26,Scientists hail the single pill that halves the risk of heart disease: Once-a-day polypill will tackle chronic diseases Good results from first international trials,"A once-a-day tablet containing four common drugs to lower cholesterol and blood pressure has been shown to halve the risk of heart disease and stroke in those who take it, opening the way to a simple form of global mass preventative medication.

The polypill has been a gleam in scientists' eyes for more than a decade. 

In 2001, the World Health Organisation and the Wellcome Trust - which funded the trial - convened a meeting to discuss the possibility of producing a single combination pill which would be a potent weapon in the battle against chronic diseases. 

A single pill, the meeting concluded, would make it more likely that those at risk of heart disease, stroke or diabetes would stick to their medication and would be much cheaper than taking several drugs.

Results from the first international trial of a polypill containing drugs to lower cholesterol and blood pressure - and also aspirin - show that it could make a major difference to the toll of chronic disease, even though they are not as good as the original polypill pioneers hoped.

Professors Sir Nicholas Wald and Malcolm Law, in a seminal article in 2003, anticipated that the polypill could cut the risk of heart disease and strokes by 80% with few side-effects.

In practice, in the trial which took place in the UK, Australia, Brazil, India, New Zealand, the Netherlands and the US, reported in the open access journal PLoS One, the predicted risk was cut by 50%, not 80%. 

And there were more side-effects than expected, affecting about one in six of those who took part in the trial. 

Most of the side-effects were mild but about one participant in 20 stopped taking the polypill as a result.

Professor Anthony Rodgers of the George Institute for Global Health, who led the trial, said he thought the results were ""more realistic than the original hope, which I think now people are realising was more like hype"". 

He described the results as ""very good, but not the panacea it was originally thought to be"".

Most side-effects were caused by the aspirin in the pill, which is known to cause gastric bleeding in some people. 

But aspirin has also been shown to cut the risk of cancer, which gives the polypill a further dimension. 

""We know from other trials that long-term there would also be a 25-50% lower death rate from colon cancer, plus reductions in other major cancers, heart failure and renal failure,"" said Rodgers.

The polypill could be most suitable for those people who have already suffered a heart attack or stroke and are therefore at risk of another one. 

They would normally be put on a cocktail of pills but some might be more likely to stick to medication if only required to take one a day.

The other group likely to be offered it are those who are at risk because they are clearly overweight or have high blood pressure and cholesterol readings. 

At one time it was thought that everybody over the age of 55 should be offered the polypill, but the side-effects make that unlikely.

The main value in the UK would be in encouraging adherence to medication, but in the developing world, where other trials are going on, the low cost may be a significant issue. 

Professor Simon Thom of Imperial College, London, who led the UK arm of the trial, said the Indian company making the polypill, which it calls the Red Heart pill, is aiming for a price in India of £13 per patient per year. 

""We anticipate the cost being somewhat more in developed countries. 

The poorer countries will be subsidised by the surcharge in the wealthier countries,"" he said.

Natasha Stewart, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""While the concept of taking one pill rather than many sounds appealing, this was a small study and we'd need to see results from much larger trials to determine the validity of its potential benefits. 

While medicines could help to reduce risk, they're not a substitute for living a healthy lifestyle, which will always remain a vital part of keeping your heart in good shape.""

Dr Lorna Layward, from the Stroke Association, said: ""Anyone at risk of stroke should be supported in reducing their risk through lifestyle changes and medication. 

Many people with high blood pressure and high cholesterol are required to take multiple pills every day in order to reduce their risk. 

Calculating when each pill needs to be taken can often be confusing and so combining the pills into one could make taking the medication much simpler.

""However, it's important to note that this pill might not be suitable for everyone and it may have side-effects so every patient should be assessed and treated on an individual basis.

The polypill will be available in the UK within a couple of years after it has gone through regulatory approval, the scientists expect, but sooner in India.","{""PLoS One"": 1}","{""Nicholas Wald"": 1, ""Malcolm Law"": 1, ""Anthony Rodgers"": 1, ""Rodgers"": 1, ""Simon Thom"": 1, ""Natasha Stewart"": 1, ""Lorna Layward"": 1}","{""the World Health Organisation"": 1, ""the Wellcome Trust"": 1, ""PLoS"": 1, ""the George Institute for Global Health"": 1, ""Imperial College"": 1, ""the British Heart Foundation"": 1, ""the Stroke Association"": 1}","{""Nicholas Wald"": 1, ""Malcolm Law"": 1, ""Anthony Rodgers"": 1, ""Rodgers"": 1, ""Simon Thom"": 1, ""Lorna Layward"": 1}","{""the World Health Organisation"": 1, ""the Wellcome Trust"": 1, ""the George Institute for Global Health"": 1, ""Imperial College"": 1, ""the British Heart Foundation"": 1, ""the Stroke Association"": 1}"
07-11-018_telegraph,2011-05-26,The 10p pill that 'halves risk of heart disease',"A 10P-A-DAY ""polypill"" containing aspirin and statins can halve the risk of heart disease and stroke, according to the world's first international trial of the drug. 

Researchers found ""sizeable reductions"" in blood pressure and levels of ""bad"" cholesterol among those who took the polypill for 12 weeks.

Separate pills are prescribed to millions of people worldwide to lower their chances of heart attack and stroke but scientists believe a combined pill will encourage people to take the medications more reliably. 

Cardiovascular disease is Britain's biggest killer, accounting for almost 200,000 deaths a year.

The first international polypill study, published today and part-funded by the Wellcome Trust, has suggested that a single pill could be extremely effective.

A research team examined data from 378 people with a raised risk of cardiovascular disease. 

Half were given the polypill and half a placebo. The participants were British, Dutch and Indian. 

The study found that both blood pressure and levels of ""bad"" cholesterol were reduced.

Systolic blood pressure was reduced from a pre-trial average of 134 mmHg - mmHg being the standard unit for measuring blood pressure - to 124.

Bad cholesterol came down from 3.7 millimoles per litre to 2.9.

It was calculated that the polypill would roughly halve the chance of a major cardiovascular event in those with a raised risk of disease. 

Writing in the journal PLoS One, the researchers said that the benefits to those at a high risk would be even greater.

Prof Anthony Rodgers, of the George Institute for Global Health in Australia, who led the study, said: ""The results show a halving in heart disease and stroke can be expected for people taking this polypill long-term. 

We are really excited.""

The combined pill contains 75mg aspirin, 20mg simvastatin, 10mg lisinopril and 12.5mg hydrochlorothiazide. 

Aspirin prevents blood getting too ""sticky"", which can lead to clots that cause heart attacks; statins lower cholesterol; while the latter two drugs lower blood pressure.

Prof Simon Thom, of Imperial College London, said the Indian pharmaceutical firm Dr Reddys had committed to make the polypill ""as dirt cheaply as possible"".

About 17million people die of cardiovascular disease every year, 80 per cent of them in developing countries. 

Prof Thom said in such countries the cost could be just £1.20 a month, with richer countries paying more. 

Even so, the cost in Britain could be as low as £3 a month. 

Prof Rodgers added that one of the hopes with a polypill is that it would help people take medicines long-term.

Dr Lorna Layward, from The Stroke Association, said combining medications into one pill could make taking the medication much simpler. 

However, she said it was ""extremely early days"" and if it came to fruition patients should be treated on an individual basis as it might not be suitable for all.

07-11-018_scotsman,2011-05-26,The pill to cure (almost) every ill,"Taking a ""polypill"" which combines four different drugs can cut people's risk of heart disease and stroke by half, the world's first international trial of the treatment has found.

The capsule, which contains aspirin and drugs to lower cholesterol and blood pressure, could potentially revolutionise the care of patients at risk of serious illness. 

Similar treatments have also been shown to cut cancers and kidney disease.

But campaigners in Scotland warned people should not see the pill as an alternative to improving their diet and taking more exercise. 

At present, separate pills are prescribed to millions of people worldwide to lower the chances of heart attack and stroke.

But for many years, researchers have been investigating the prospect of a combined pill, with some suggesting it could even be taken by everyone over the age of 55 to cut the risk of disease.

Many also believe that combining the medications in one pill could make it easier for people to take and stick with.

In the latest study, published in the journal Public Library of Science One, experts tested the pill in 378 people in countries including the UK and US who did not already need any of its components, but who had more than a 7.5 per cent estimated risk of cardiovascular disease.

The drug contained 75mg of aspirin, the two blood pressure drugs lisinopril (10mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5mg), and 20mg of the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin.

After 12 weeks, experts analysed the effect of the drug on blood pressure and cholesterol, and how well it was tolerated.

It did cause side-effects, including stomach irritation and coughs, in about one in six people, and some participants stopped taking the treatment because of this.

But overall, the study found the risk of heart disease and stroke was significantly reduced.

Professor Anthony Rodgers, of the George Institute for Global Health, said: ""The results show a halving in heart disease and stroke can be expected for people taking this polypill long-term.

""We know from other trials that long term there would also be a 25-50 per cent lower death rate from colon cancer, plus reductions in other major cancers, heart failure and renal failure.

""These benefits would take several years to 'kick in', but of course one of the hopes with a polypill is it helps people take medicines long-term.""

Prof Rodgers said a polypill could be available in the UK in as little as one to two years. 

The cost could be as low as GBP2 a month per patient. 

""There are large numbers of people who could potentially benefit,"" he said.

Professor Simon Thom of Imperial College London, who led the British part of the trial, said: ""We now need to conduct larger trials to test whether these medicines are best as a polypill or as separate medicines, and whether this combination strategy improves patient adherence to cardiovascular medication.""

Louise Peardon, of charity Chest, Heart and Stroke Scotland, said they would prefer people took action to live healthier lifestyles. 

""Things like the polypill are a good idea, but the concerns would be around medicalising risk factors,"" she said.

""Our approach would be on the side of encouraging lifestyle changes first.""

Andy Carver, of British Heart Foundation Scotland, added: ""While the concept of taking one pill rather than many sounds appealing, this was a small study and we'd need to see results from much larger trials.

""Medicines are not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle.""

Recipe for health

What is in the polypill and what does it do?

Aspirin 75mg

A low dose of aspirin, to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke.

Research also shows aspirin can reduce risk of cancer in the long term, including colon cancer, and also cancer of the prostate, lung and oesophagus.

The effects on cancer can be seen after five years of use.

Lisinopril 10mg and Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg

Two different types of drugs to lower blood pressure are used, because research shows it is better to use a low to medium dose of two drugs rather than a high dose of one drug.

This allows for a good reduction in blood pressure, with few side effects.

Having high blood pressure puts extra strain on the heart and blood vessels, which can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.

High blood pressure can also cause heart and kidney disease, and has been linked to some forms of dementia.

Simvastatin 20mg

A member of the group of drugs called statins, which are commonly used to lower cholesterol levels.

Evidence strongly shows that high cholesterol levels can cause narrowing of the arteries - known as atherosclerosis - leading to heart attack and stroke.

This is because cholesterol can build up in the artery wall and restrict the flow of blood to the heart, brain and the rest of the body.

It also increases the chance of a blood clot developing.","{""Public Library of Science One"": 1}","{""Anthony Rodgers"": 1, ""Rodgers"": 1, ""Simon Thom"": 1, ""Louise Peardon"": 1, ""Andy Carver"": 1, ""Simvastatin 20mg"": 1}","{""the George Institute for Global Health"": 1, ""Imperial College London"": 1, ""Chest, Heart"": 1, ""Stroke Scotland"": 1, ""British Heart Foundation Scotland"": 1}","{""Rodgers"": 1, ""Simon Thom"": 1}","{""the George Institute for Global Health"": 1, ""Imperial College London"": 1, ""Chest, Heart"": 1, ""Stroke Scotland"": 1, ""British Heart Foundation Scotland"": 1}"
12-11-026_dailymail,2011-11-01,YOGA 'IS BETTER AT TREATING A BAD BACK THAN GOING TO THE DOCTOR',"ITS fans claim it helps the body fight aches and pains through a range of stretches.

But it would seem that the ancient practice of yoga really does work Z and it could be even better than going to the doctor.

Patients with a common form of lower back pain who did three months of classes in the therapeutic discipline were able to do daily chores they previously would have found impossible, say scientists.

And some claimed the effects continued for a year after they had finished the sessions.

The extent to which yoga helps the body and mind remains highly contested however and only last week researchers from the U.S. claimed it brought no improvement to wellbeing.

But a team from the University of York have looked at its effects on around 300 patients with chronic lower back pain, a common condition which affects one in five adults in any given year.

Half followed a 12-week course of yoga, with specific exercise focusing on their back.

The remainder carried on visiting their GP and were given painkillers, exercises to follow and in some cases physiotherapy.

The findings, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, show that after three months patients who had been to the yoga classes were able to do 30 per cent more daily activities than those who had carried on seeing their family doctor.

However, yoga did not seem to relieve patients' pain, it only enabled them to carry out more household chores, such as gardening.

And 12 patients who had completed the yoga reported suffering episodes of severe pain, which may have been caused by their stretches.

Nonetheless the researchers claimed yoga helped patients feel more confident in carrying out chores despite their pain.

Chief Investigator Professor David Torgerson said: 'Back pain is an extremely common and costly condition.

'Exercise treatment, although widely used and recommended, has only a small effect on back pain.

'We therefore set out to investigate an alternative approach using a specially-developed weekly yoga programme for back pain sufferers to see if this allowed them to manage their back pain more successfully.'

Professor Alan Silman, Medical Director of Arthritis Research UK, which funded the study said: 'We're delighted that our trial has shown that yoga provides such positive benefits for people with chronic low back pain.

'This extremely common condition cannot be managed with painkillers alone and there is an urgent need to have non-drug therapies that sufferers can utilise in their own home.'

Around 80 per cent of Britons will suffer chronic lower back pain at some point in their lives.

Painkillers are often ineffective and many patients try alternative forms of therapy such as acupuncture, exercise or massages to relieve symptoms.","{""Annals of Internal Medicine"": 1}","{""David Torgerson"": 1, ""Alan Silman"": 1}","{""ITS"": 1, ""the University of York"": 1, ""the Annals of Internal Medicine"": 1, ""Arthritis Research UK"": 1}","{""David Torgerson"": 1}","{""ITS"": 1, ""the University of York"": 1, ""Arthritis Research UK"": 1}"

It provides 30% more effective relief than care with exercise and painkillers, according to the largestever study into its benefits.

Eight in 10 Brits suffer back pain at some point, with an estimated 4.9 million working days lost.

The study, led by the University of York and funded by Arthritis Research UK, involved sufferers who were receiving GP care for chronic back pain.

A 156-strong group was offered group yoga classes specially designed to improve back function, while the second batch of 157 were offered GP care alone.

After three months, the yoga group were able to undertake 30% more activities compared with the standard care group.

There was also a reduction in pain.

Prof David Torgerson, of York University's health sciences department, said: ""Back pain is an extremely common and costly condition.

12-11-026_times,2011-11-01,Got a pain in the back? Then try yoga instead of a trip to the doctor,"Yoga is more effective at alleviating lower back pain than conventional medical treatment, a trial has found.

After a 12-week course of yoga, patients with long-term back pain reported less discomfort, performed better physically and were more confident in performing everyday tasks than those offered conventional GP care.

While improvements were most pronounced at three months, immediately after the yoga course, people who were assigned to the yoga group still had less pain a year after the start of the study.

David Torgerson, director of the Trials Unit at the University of York, said: ""Doctors should be able to suggest yoga classes as an approach that could help.""

The study, published today in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, assigned 156 patients to yoga classes and a control group of 157 patients to standard GP care.

Those in the control group received a range of interventions, including mild pain relief medication, physiotherapy and advice to remain active and avoid heavy lifting.

On average, members of the yoga group were able to undertake 30 per cent more activities compared with those in the usual care group after three months.

Lower back pain affects 80 per cent of the UK population at some point.

It is estimated that about 4.9 million working days a year are lost to it, but few effective, evidence-based treatments exist.

The yoga programme, which involved 20 experienced yoga teachers, was designed and delivered by Alison Trewhela, from Truro, Cornwall, an Iyengar Yoga teacher and Senior Practitioner in Yoga on the British Register of Complementary Practitioners.

The classes were designed for complete beginners, with yoga teachers given extra training in back care.

Participants were recruited from 39 general practices in seven Primary Care Trust areas, with classes held in non-NHS premises in Cornwall, North London, West London, Manchester and York.

Professor Alan Silman, medical director of Arthritis Research UK, said: ""This trial is part of our larger commitment to seek self-help solutions to this common musculoskeletal problem.

There are compelling explanations why yoga may be helpful and this trial lends powerful support to the wider use of this approach.""

Sue Faulkner, 68, from Bishopthorpe in York, who took part in the trial said that yoga had helped herto resume hobbies and a more active life.

12-11-026_guardian,2011-11-01,Yoga is best treatment for bad back,"Yoga is more effective in helping people with lower back pain to become more mobile than the conventional treatments GPs offer.

A study found sufferers could perform everyday tasks like walking, bending down and dressing more easily if they did weekly yoga, and they reported enhanced function even nine months after the classes.

Smaller earlier studies have suggested benefits from yoga, but these were often with one teacher and without long-term follow-up.

Back pain is estimated to affect 80% of adults at some point; one in five people visit their GP in any given year due to it.

It is defined as chronic if it lasts more than six weeks, and is the second biggest cause of long-term disability after arthritis, and is second only to stress as a cause of absence from work.

It costs the NHS £1bn a year, and the economy an estimated £20bn a year.

Conventional treatment offers painkillers, spinal manipulation, acupuncture, and cognitive behavioural therapy.

""In the past, you were told to lie down until the pain passed,"" said Prof David Torgerson, of the University of York, who led the study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

12-11-026_reuters,2011-10-31,Yoga has small benefit for chronic back pain: study,"In a new UK study of adults with chronic lower back pain, a 12-week yoga class led to a small improvement in how well participants could perform daily activities, but did not ease their pain.

The report follows another recent study from Washington State that found modest and similar benefits from yoga and stretching classes in people with chronic back pain.

gives us more confidence that the benefits seen with this class-based intervention seem to apply when it's done in different areas by different teachers,"" said Dr. Timothy Carey, from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who has researched back pain but wasn't involved in either report.

The UK study, led by David Torgerson from the University of York, involved 313 adults who'd had chronic or recurring back pain for an average of 10 years.

They were randomly split into two groups -- one of which went to yoga classes once a week for 12 weeks, and the other that was only given a back pain information booklet.

The yoga classes included breathing and relaxation techniques as well as poses to improve strength and mobility.

People in that group were also given mats and encouraged to practice a couple of times a week at home.

Before and after the 12-week program, the participants filled out questionnaires on how much trouble they had with daily tasks, their pain and general health.

Average ""disability"" levels started out at 8 on a scale of 0 to 24 in both groups, with 24 representing the most difficulty with everyday activities.

By the end of the yoga classes, those scores had dropped more than 2 points, to between 5.5 and 6 among yoga participants, but didn't change in the non-yoga group.

A 2-point difference is something a patient would notice, Carey told Reuters Health, but ""we're not talking cure here.""

The improved functioning remained for the nine months that the researchers tracked participants after the trial ended.

However, there was no clear difference in back pain in the yoga group compared to people who were just given an educational booklet.

Both improved by an average of 1 to 4 points on a 100-point pain scale.

Researchers have wondered whether yoga might be a good option for people with chronic back pain because it rarely causes serious side effects and can be done relatively cheaply in group classes -- or individually for no money at all, once the techniques are learned.

""An advantage of yoga is that a lot of people practice yoga at home.

It seemed to be a therapy that not only could you be trained how to do it, you could continue after the (classes) had finished,"" Torgerson told Reuters Health.

He said that the researchers couldn't tell from the study whether it was only the stretching and exercise elements of yoga that made a difference for patients, as the Washington study suggested -- or whether some of its mind-body components were helpful as well.

Regardless, they wrote in their Annals of Internal Medicine report that a long-term yoga program might help maintain the improvements in back function seen in people who took the classes.

And they added that future research should measure the effects of yoga alongside other common treatments for chronic back pain, including spinal manipulation and talk therapy, to see how it stacks up in comparison.

A single yoga or stretching session may cost about $20, making it cheaper than the alternative treatments.

Carey said that general exercise and stretching -- whether it's done in a yoga class or not -- is helpful for most people with chronic back pain.

""The important thing about exercise is, you need to do a type of exercise that you enjoy and that you can work with in your schedule and your lifestyle,"" he said.

""It's important to kind of hang in there with the exercise, and I think that's where the classes may help,"" Carey added.

12-11-028_reuters,2011-11-14,Phone therapy and exercise can ease chronic pain,"Patients with chronic and widespread pain who got a course of a talking treatment called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on the phone reported feeling ""better"" or ""very much better"" after 6 months, the results of study showed Monday.

Researchers from Britain's universities of Aberdeen and Manchester who conducted the study also found that exercise improved pain and disability and helped people manage their symptoms, but there was no extra benefit for those who got both CBT and exercise treatment.

Chronic widespread pain is a main feature of a condition known as fibromyalgia that affects around 10 percent of the population and is extremely difficult to treat.

Pain in general is notoriously tricky to manage successfully and contributes a huge health burden worldwide -- estimated to cost more than 200 billion euros ($275 bln) a year in Europe and some $150 billion a year in the United States.

Studies show that around 22 percent of people with chronic pain become depressed and 25 percent go on to lose their jobs.

In this study, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine journal, the researchers said that in the United States, for example, the average costs per patient -- including pain and non-pain-related medicines, doctor consultations, tests and procedures and emergency department visits -- in the six months after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia were $3,481.

""There is a need to develop clinically effective and cost-effective, acceptable interventions at a primary care level that could potentially be available to a large number of patients,"" Gary Macfarlane of the University of Aberdeen and John McBeth of the University of Manchester wrote.

And these results ""demonstrate that we can improve symptoms for many people,"" MacFarlane said in a statement about the findings.

""We have examined two options -- a graded exercise program and CBT -- and found both to be effective.""

Although it is known that CBT can be effective in managing pain, it is expensive to deliver and often requires many hours of contact between patients and specialist therapists.

Because of this, the researchers wanted to see if delivering CBT by phone -- a far cheaper method -- could also work.

The trial, involving 442 people with chronic widespread pain aged between 25 and 60, was aimed at developing more effective ways of reducing or coping with painful symptoms.

The patients were split into groups -- one doing exercise, another receiving CBT, a third receiving a combination of both, and a fourth who were given the usual care by their doctors.

The exercise treatment comprised six fitness instructor-led monthly appointments and patients were recommended to exercise between 20 and 60 minutes a day with increasing intensity over a six-month period.

18-11-004_telegraph,2011-04-01,Brain link to anti-social and yobbish behaviour in teenagers,"Bad behaviour in teenagers could be explained by stunted growth of the ""caring-sharing"" areas of their brains, study suggests. 

Scientists have found that yobs and hoodies have smaller regions of the brain that deal with emotions especially fear and the ability to feel the pain of others. 

This suggests that their anti-social behaviour could have a biological basis and could lead to possible new treatments. 

The study led by Cambridge University attempted to explain why five per cent of school age children suffer from Conduct Disorder (CD), a recognised psychiatric condition characterised by aggressive and anti-social traits. 

They looked at 63 boys with an average age of 18 with CD, some of whom developed problems at an early age and some who began to display anti-social behaviour in adolescence. 

They were compared with a group of 27 ""normal"" teenagers from similar backgrounds. 

Brain scans showed that two regions were significantly smaller in affected teenagers, including those who only became badly behaved when they reached adolescence. 

The two areas were the amygdala and insula, which contribute to emotional perception, empathy, and the ability to recognise when others are in distress. 

Rates of CD have increased sharply around the world since the 1950s. 

The condition can develop in young children, or not show itself until the teenage years. 

Those affected are at greater risk of mental problems, substance abuse and criminality in later life. 

It has long been thought that adolescent-onset CD is merely the result of susceptible teenagers imitating badly-behaved peers. 

But the new research challenges this view, pointing to brain changes that affect all youngsters with the condition. 

The scientists are cautious about how to interpret the findings, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry. 

Professor Ian Goodyer, one of the researchers, said: ""We hope that our results will contribute to existing psychosocial strategies for detecting children at high risk of developing anti-social behaviour."" 

He stressed their study had not demonstrated a foolproof ""test"" and only provided a springboard for further, more extensive, research. 

He said environmental and family factors also played a part. 

Dr Graeme Fairchild, co-author from the University of Southampton, said: Changes in grey matter volume in these areas of the brain could explain why teenagers with conduct disorder have difficulties in recognising emotions in others. 

""Further studies are now needed to investigate whether these changes in brain structure are a cause or a consequence of the disorder."" 

Dr Andy Calder, from the Medical Research Council's Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, another author, said: ""Only when we are confident that we understand why the disorder develops can we apply this knowledge to the further development and evaluation of treatments.

18-11-004_reuters,2011-03-31,Antisocial behavior shows in teenage brain scans,"LONDON Brain scans of aggressive, antisocial teenage boys with the condition known as conduct disorder have found differences in the size and structure of parts of the brain that may be linked to their behavior.

A study by British scientists showed the differences were there regardless of the age at which the patients developed the disorder -- a finding which challenges the view that adolescents who develop conduct disorder are merely imitating badly behaved peers and do not have differences in their brains.

Conduct disorder (CD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by higher than normal levels of aggressive and antisocial behavior. It is more common in boys than girls, can develop in childhood or in adolescence, and experts say it affects around five out of every 100 teenagers. Children and adolescents with CD are at greater risk of developing further mental and physical health problems when they are adults.

In the study, neuroscientists at the University of Cambridge and the Medical Research Council's Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit used magnetic resonance imaging to measure the size of particular regions in the brains of 63 teenage boys with conduct disorder compared with 27 teenage boys who showed no symptoms of behavioral disorder.

Their findings, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry on Friday, showed that the amygdala and insula -- regions of the brain that contribute to emotion perception, empathy and recognizing when other people are in distress -- were strikingly smaller in teenagers with antisocial behavior.

The changes were present both in those with childhood-onset CD and in adolescence-onset CD, and the greater the severity of the behavior problems, the greater the reduction in the volume of the insula, the scientists said.

""Changes in grey matter volume in these areas of the brain could explain why teenagers with conduct disorder have difficulties in recognizing emotions in others,"" said Graeme Fairchild, who led the research and is now based at the Britain's Southampton University.

He said more studies were needed to investigate whether these changes in brain structure are a cause or a consequence of conduct disorder.

While that might seem quite skilful, they warn that such sedentary behaviour is believed to increase the risk of obesity and mental health problems in youngsters. 

It is now possible to watch TV 'on demand' via the internet, play computer games on laptops, hand-held devices or mobile phones, keep in contact with friends using text, Facebook, Skype, and MSN, and to do all this concurrently.

The study questioned 63 ten and 11-year-olds and found the children enjoyed looking at more than one screen at a time.

They use a second device to fill in breaks during their entertainment, often talking or texting friends during adverts or while they were waiting for computer games to load.

15-11-007_dailymail,2011-03-31,Why we'll go an extra mile for our friends... and for the success of humans as a species,"There could be hope, it seems, for the Me, Me, Me Generation.

When put to the test we are actually willing to do more for our friends than ourselves.

In an intriguing experiment, volunteers were asked to squat against a wall with their knees at right angles – a ski training exercise which becomes increasingly painful with time.

They were told to hold the position for as long as they could and paid 1p for every second they spent squatting.

The volunteers performed the exercise five times, once for themselves and four more times to win the money on the behalf of different colleagues.

In a result that paints a more altruistic picture of society than we might expect these days, they often endured more pain for their closest friends than for themselves.

The study’s author, Dr Freya Harrison, of Oxford University’s zoology department, said that while the numbers involved were small, there were lessons to be learned.

‘Of the 17 people involved, ten of them squatted longer for at least one of their recipients as for themselves and so there is something going on,’ she said.

‘Some people squatted twice as long for their closest link than for themselves.

‘I think that if our results hold in general and people really do go the extra mile for close friends, compared with when they invest effort for themselves, it points to the importance of co-operation in our species.

‘It suggests that maintaining social ties and working together has been an important factor in the success of humans as a species.’

So there is something in it for us, after all. 

Previous research found people were unwilling to stick to the squat manoeuvre any longer for relatives than for themselves, suggesting we value friends over family.

Dr Harrison, whose research was published in the journal PLoS ONE, had an explanation for this as well.  

‘Maybe that’s because friends are a lot more important in determining social benefits than relatives,’ she said.

‘Alternatively, it could be that the role of a relative doesn’t need working on because family members have genes in common already. 

‘Perhaps we can rely on help from our parents or siblings because it’s almost always in our best interest to help someone who shares our genes.’ 

Dr Harrison, who did the study with colleagues from the University of Bath, now wants to look at how the phenomenon would play out in a more hierarchical organisation, such as the police or Army. 

‘If you were low down the pecking order in the police, say, you would expect the fact that someone had power over you to cancel out friendships,’ she said.","{""PLoS ONE"": 1}","{""Freya Harrison"": 1, ""Harrison"": 2}","{""Oxford University"": 1, ""PLoS ONE"": 1, ""the University of Bath"": 1, ""Army"": 1}","{""Freya Harrison"": 1, ""Harrison"": 1}","{""Oxford University"": 1, ""the University of Bath"": 1, ""Army"": 1}"
15-11-011_sun,2011-05-10,BREASTFEED 4 MONTHS OR CHILD WILL BE BAD; Latest advice to new mums,"MUMS should breastfeed for at least four months to avoid having naughty kids, experts now advise.

It follows one of the biggest studies on breast-feeding yet.

Renowned Oxford University researchers examined the health and behaviour of almost 10,000 mums and their children for five years.

They found that the children who were breastfed for four months or more were far better behaved.

They also socialised better with other kids by their fifth birthday.

Behavioural problems more common among bottle-fed babies ranged from hyperactivity, anxiety and restlessness - to stealing and lying.

The researchers took into account other factors which could influence kids' behaviour - such as time spent with their parents at home.

But breastfed infants were still found to be 30 per cent less likely to be badly behaved.

The team - led by leading UK public health expert Maria Quigley - is unsure what causes the effect.

It could be the bonding process - or breastmilk nutrients such as fatty acids, which boost growth of brain cells.

They called for further studies to investigate the link.

Breast milk has long been known to stave off infections, and reduce the risk of illnesses such as asthma and eczema.

Department of Health guidelines state that women should try to solely breastfeed until babies hit six months.

Many do this, but it is common for others to try for at least the first three months before they switch to a mixture of breast and formula milk.

Large numbers only bottle-feed their babies - due to difficulty feeding, lack of time, or other reasons.

Ms Quigley called on authorities to help mums breastfeed.

She said: ""Many struggle to breastfeed for as long as they might otherwise like. They should be given all the support they need.""",,"{""Maria Quigley"": 1, ""Quigley"": 1}","{""MUMS"": 1, ""Oxford University"": 1, ""Department of Health"": 1}","{""Maria Quigley"": 1, ""Quigley"": 1}","{""Oxford University"": 1}"
15-11-011_guardian,2011-05-09,"Breastfeeding leads to better behaviour in children, researchers claim","Interaction between mother and child seen as significant factor in research based on Millennium Cohort Study.

Babies who are breastfed are less likely to have behavioural problems by the age of five than those given formula milk, according to new research.

The question of whether breastfeeding has a long-term impact on behaviour has been investigated before, but the studies have usually been small-scale and inconsistent in their findings.

But a large research project carried out by the universities of Oxford, Essex and York, together with University College London, has come to a more robust conclusion.

They used data from the ongoing Millennium Cohort Study, a survey of babies born in the UK during a 12-month period between 2000 and 2001.

More than 10,000 mother and baby pairs of white ethnic background took part.

They were interviewed when the baby was nine months old and again at two-yearly intervals.

The researchers asked parents to fill in questionnaires to assess their children's potential behavioural difficulties.

These included emotional issues such as clinginess and anxiety, hyperactivity such as restlessness, and conduct problems such as lying and stealing.

Fewer than a third of the babies born at full-term (29%) and a fifth (21%) of those born prematurely were breastfed for at least four months.

But only 4% of the breastfed babies showed a tendency to behavioural problems compared with 16% of those fed formula milk.

The difference in the full-term babies was still significant even when other influences were taken into account, such as socioeconomic status and the mother's education, age and smoking habits.

However, the association was not clear among the 512 children who were born prematurely.

The researchers, writing in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood, say they are not concerned with ordinary childhood misbehaviour.

""Children learn appropriate behaviour from people around them and, during the learning process, all children sometimes behave inappropriately – for example, have temper tantrums or are aggressive,"" they write.

""Behavioural problems, however, are inappropriate behaviours that occur repeatedly over a period of time, have a negative impact on the child's development and interfere with the child's or their family's everyday life.""

They offer two possible explanations for their findings.

One is that breast milk contains large amounts of essential fatty acids, which are known to have an important role in the development and function of the brain and central nervous system.

But in the past decade, they note, formula manufacturers have been supplementing their products with essential fatty acids and it is likely that the children in the study were given supplemented formula milk.

The other possible answer, they write, is that ""breastfeeding leads to more interaction between the mother and the child, better learning of acceptable behaviours and fewer behavioural problems"".

Peter Kinderman, professor of clinical psychology at Liverpool University, called it ""a very good piece of research published in an important journal"".

He said he suspected the mother-child bonding that takes place during breastfeeding might be the most important factor.

""Positive bonding between parent and child is known to be fantastically helpful for development,"" he said, noting that the authors specifically took into account factors such as childcare arrangements because they are so well-established as important influences in development.

""This is more evidence of the importance of breastfeeding and mother-baby attachment, not just for physical health but also for the psychological development of the child,"" he said.

The authors said that more work needed to be done to see if their findings would contrast with other ethnic groups.","{""Archives of Disease in Childhood"": 1}","{""Peter Kinderman"": 1}","{""Millennium Cohort Study"": 1, ""University College London"": 1, ""Archives of Disease in Childhood"": 1, ""Liverpool University"": 1}",,"{""University College London"": 1, ""Liverpool University"": 1}"
15-11-011_telegraph,2011-05-10,"Breastfed children are better behaved

Breastfed children are more likely to be better behaved, according to an Oxford University-led study.","Researchers have found that those who are breastfed for at least four months as babies are 30 per cent less likely to exhibit a range of behavioural problems when they start school. 

Such problems include anxiety, clinginess, bad behaviour such as lying and stealing, as well as being hyperactive. 

Critics of such studies, which many fear stigmatise those who do not breastfeed, say that mothers that do tend to be older, better educated and better off. 

But the researchers said their findings, reported in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood, were after these differences had been statistically taken into account. 

Maria Quigley of Oxford University's National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, who led the study, said: ""We found that children who were breastfed for at least four months were less likely to have behavioural problems at age five."" 

The team, which also included academics from Essex University, York University and University College London, looked at a group of 9,500 white children born in 2000 and 2001, included in a project called the Millennium Cohort Study. 

As part of a wide-ranging interview on parenting, mothers were asked when their children were nine months old whether they had breastfed their offspring and - if so - for how long. 

Parents were re-interviewed about once every two years.

When the children were five, they were asked to gauge their children's behaviour in a series of standard questions, which researchers compiled into quantitative scores for each trait. 

Children in the top 10 per cent for each were classified as having an 'abnormal' score. 

The 'raw figures' showed that 16 per cent of formula-fed babies had abnormal behavioural scores aged five, compared to 6.5 per cent of babies breast fed for at least four months - a more than two-fold difference, 

However, after social differences between mothers were taken into account there was only a 30 per cent difference. 

Miss Quigley emphasised of those with 'abnormal' scores: ""We’re not necessarily talking about tearaway, unmanageable five-year-old kids. 

""It might be unusual anxiousness, restlessness, inability to socialise with other children or play fully in groups."" 

Other studies have shown that breastfed children are more likely to have higher IQs, fewer infections and less likely to be obese, but exactly why remains unknown.

15-11-011_scotsman,2011-05-10,"Breast-fed babies better behaved, new study finds","Breast-fed babies turn into better behaved children, British research suggests.

A study involving thousands of mothers and youngsters found that breastfeeding for four months or more was linked to children having fewer behavioural problems by the age of five.

Researchers said the findings added to the growing evidence on the benefits of breastfeeding.

Previous studies have found breastfeeding has many health benefits including a reduced risk of infections, obesity and eczema, while some have even suggested it could boost intelligence.

For the latest work, published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood, the researchers used data from the Millennium Cohort Study involving over 10,000 mothers and child pairs born in the UK in 2000-1.

The participants were interviewed when their child was nine months, and revisited every two years.

A questionnaire was used to score children at the age of five and identify potential behavioural problems, such as emotional clinginess and anxiety, hyperactivity and bad conduct such as lying and stealing.

The researchers, from the universities of Oxford, Essex and York and University College London, found that abnormal scores indicating potential behavioural problems were less common in youngsters breast-fed for at least four months (6.5 per cent) than in children fed with formula milk (16 per cent).

The lower risk of behavioural issues found in breast-fed children remained even when the researchers took into account other factors which could have an influence, such as levels of deprivation or parental factors such as age and education.

Breast-fed children were still 30 per cent less likely to have behavioural problems than the bottle-fed infants.

The researchers, led by Maria Quigley at Oxford's National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, said there were several reasons why breast milk may improve behaviour.

One possible suggestion is that breast milk contains large amounts of essential long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, growth factors and hormones which play a role in the development and function of the brain and nervous system.

The value of fatty acids means that over the last decade manufacturers have started to supplement formula milks with them, though the effectiveness of supplementation remains unclear, the researchers said.

Another possible explanation for improved behaviour could be that breast-feeding leads to more interaction between the mother and child, which can lead to fewer problems with behaviour.

""Our results provide even more evidence for the benefits of breastfeeding,"" Dr Quigley said.

""Mothers who want to breastfeed should be given all the support they need.

15-11-011_bbcnews,2011-05-10,Breastfed babies 'develop fewer behaviour problems',"Children who are breastfed for four months or more develop fewer behaviour problems, Oxford researchers say.

The study, involving 10,000 mothers and their babies and in journal Archives of Disease in Childhood, says that may be because of the make-up of breast milk.

Or, it says, breastfeeding may lead to better mother-baby interaction.

Breastfeeding is already associated with other health benefits for babies, including lower rates of infection and less obesity in later life. 

Researchers looked at the feeding habits of 10,037 mothers and their babies involved in a large study known as the Millennium Cohort Study. 

Behaviour problems

The mothers were asked to assess problems in their children by the age of five, including anxiousness and clinginess, restlessness, and lying or stealing. 

Only 6% of children who were breastfed showed signs of behaviour problems, compared with 16% of children who were formula-fed.

Mothers who breastfeed tend to be older, better educated, and from a higher socio-economic background, which may contribute towards fewer problems in their children's behaviour.

But even after the researchers, from the Universities of Oxford, Essex, York and University College London, adjusted their figures to take that into account, they still found there was a 30% greater risk of behavioural problems among formula-fed children. 

""Our results provide even more evidence for the benefits of breastfeeding,"" said Maria Quigley of Oxford University, who led the research. 

She said breast milk contained large quantities of a particular type of fatty acid, as well as growth factors and hormones, which were important for the development of the brain and nervous system.

But mothers who breastfeed also tend to interact with their children more, which could mean the babies learn more about acceptable ways of behaving. 

Breastfed children also get ill less often, which may affect their behaviour. 

Close interaction

""We just don't know whether it is because of the constituents in breast milk, or the close interaction with the mum, or whether it is a knock-on effect of reduced illness in breastfed babies,"" said Ms Quigley.

""But it does begin to look like we can add fewer behavioural problems as another potential benefit of breastfeeding.""

The Royal College of Midwives welcomed the findings and said they added to the evidence that breastfeeding was better for babies.

Janet Fyle from the RCM said it was vital women had enough help and support from midwives to help them keep breastfeeding.

But she said it was important not to over-emphasise the study's results.

05-11-023_dailymail,2011-08-10,HOW HALF OF YOUR INTELLIGENCE COMES FROM YOUR PARENTS,"IF you struggle with sums or can't finish a crossword, who should you curse Ð your teachers or your parents?

Well according to the latest evidence, you really should blame both.

Researchers have found that up to half of our intelligence (or lack of it) is inherited.

They examined the blood of more than 3,500 people from England and Scotland for half a million genetic markers Ð tiny changes in their DNA.

Analysis of these results and those of intelligence tests completed by the study's participants revealed that 40 per cent of the differences in 'crystallised-type intelligence', the ability to acquire knowledge and skills over the years, were in the genes.

So-called fluid-type intelligence, the ability to reason and think abstractly under pressure, was governed by genetics to an even greater extent.

Some 51 per cent of a person's ability to 'think outside the box' is down to DNA, the journal Molecular Psychiatry reports.

The research, made possible by a new type of genetic analysis pioneered by Peter Visscher of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research in Australia, points to numerous genes being involved.

Lead researcher Professor Ian Deary, of the University of Edinburgh, said: 'Individual differences in intelligence are strongly associated with many important life outcomes, including educational and occupational attainments, income, health and lifespan.'

However, he added that the study's results 'unequivocally confirm that a substantial proportion of individual differences in human intelligence is due to genetic variation'.

He hopes to unlock the secrets of those whose brains age well, with a view to helping others stay sharp as they get older.

'If we can find specific genetic contributions to people's experience of cognitive ageing, this can suggest the mechanisms by which people differ,' he said.

'We are studying genetics to find out how things work.'

Professor Deary added that those dealt a poor hereditary hand should not act as if their fate is sealed, as it is possible for people to overcome their intellectual inheritance.

The research may explain why humans have advanced so much further than chimpanzees, despite their genetic similarity.

Simon Underdown, an anthropologist from Oxford Brookes University, said: 'The devil is clearly in the detail.

It is not necessarily that we share the same genes Ð it is how they interact with other genes that controls intelligence.

'Human intelligence is a stunning product of our evolution and this brilliantly demonstrates that the genetic basis for our intelligence is not the result of a simple mutation in a single gene.

'It moves away from the old-fashioned idea that there may be a gene or a couple of genes for intelligence.

It looks as if there are lots and lots of genes across the chromosomes.'","{""Molecular Psychiatry"": 1}","{""Peter Visscher"": 1, ""Ian Deary"": 1, ""Deary"": 1, ""Simon Underdown"": 1}","{""Molecular Psychiatry"": 1, ""the Queensland Institute of Medical Research"": 1, ""the University of Edinburgh"": 1, ""Oxford Brookes University"": 1}","{""Ian Deary"": 1, ""Deary"": 2, ""Simon Underdown"": 1}","{""Molecular Psychiatry"": 1, ""the Queensland Institute of Medical Research"": 1, ""the University of Edinburgh"": 1, ""Oxford Brookes University"": 1}"
05-11-023_times,2011-08-10,"Scientists make better sense of the classic intelligence puzzle; There is not one, but hundreds of cleverness genes","Genetic factors explain about half the differences between individual people's intelligence, even though there is no single gene that has a large effect, a major study has shown.

Hundreds or thousands of genes, each of which has only a tiny effect by itself, add up to create a large genetic influence over different levels of general intelligence, according to a DNA study of more than 3,500 people.

The findings, from a team led by Ian Deary, of the University of Edinburgh, offer the strongest and most direct evidence yet for a strong genetic effect on intelligence.

However, the research also demonstrates that inherited factors work in concert with the environment.

Intelligence is not shaped by nature or nurture alone, but by both.

About 40 per cent of the variation in knowledge, or ""crystalline-type intelligence"", and about 50 per cent of differences in problem-solving skills, or ""fluid-type intelligence"", were explained by genetic factors.

""These new findings tell us that we have found genetic signals associated with people's intelligence differences,"" Professor Deary said.

""We have not found the actual genetic differences that cause some intelligence differences, but we now have evidence that some of the genetic causes are linked to those genetic factors that we tested.

The findings also leave a lot of room for environmental influences and for interactions between people's genes and their environments.

""It is a start to understanding the observed relationship between people's thinking skills and outcomes in life.""

In the study, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, Professor Deary's team took DNA from more than 3,500 people from Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Newcastle and Manchester who were enrolled in four long-running population studies.

The results were checked against similar data from Norway.

The scientists then examined almost 600,000 points at which DNA commonly varies in ""spelling"", and compared the results against data from two types of intelligence test.

Although the technique did not identify any genetic variations that had an effect on intelligence by themselves, they found that broad patterns of genetic variation correlated closely with it.

Professor Deary said that the results could eventually provide insights into cognitive decline in old age.

""For us, the main practical problem is looking for environmental and genetic variants that are associated with thinking skills in old age,"" he said.

""If we can find out why some people's thinking skills age better than others then that would be a good start to finding mechanisms and providing clues to ameliorating age-related cognitive decline.""

Robert Plomin, of the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, said: ""We have known for decades that the heritability of IQ is about 50 per cent - it is the most studied trait in twin and adoption studies.

However, what is new in this paper is the application of a method that allows the estimation of heritability directly from hundreds of thousands of DNA markers.""

Simon Underdown, senior lecturer in biological anthropology at Oxford Brookes University, said: ""Human intelligence is a stunning product of our evolution and this paper brilliantly demonstrates that the genetic basis for our intelligence is not the result of a simple mutation in a single gene.

Rather the diverse range of genes that appear to influence our ability to think must have been actively selected for over hundreds of thousands of years.""","{""Molecular Psychiatry"": 1}","{""Ian Deary"": 1, ""Deary"": 3, ""Robert Plomin"": 1, ""Simon Underdown"": 1}","{""the University of Edinburgh"": 1, ""Molecular Psychiatry"": 1, ""the Institute of Psychiatry"": 1, ""King's College London"": 1, ""Oxford Brookes University"": 1}","{""Ian Deary"": 1, ""Deary"": 4}","{""the University of Edinburgh"": 1, ""Molecular Psychiatry"": 1, ""the Institute of Psychiatry"": 1, ""King's College London"": 1, ""Oxford Brookes University"": 1}"

Intelligence runs in families, but no single genes have yet been identified that can be reliably linked to mental ability.

Instead researchers think many hundreds or thousands of genes could be involved, each with a small influence.

Professor Ian Deary of the University of Edinburgh led the research.

To test his idea, researchers looked at more than 500,000 locations in the genetic code of 3,511 unrelated adults.

They found that 40% of the variation in knowledge and 51% of the variation in problem-solving skills between individuals could be accounted for by differences in DNA.

The results were published yesterday in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.

Previous work on the environmental and genetic contributions to cognitive ability has been based on comparing intelligence in identical and non-identical twins, or studying it in people who were adopted.

In the study led by Deary, the conclusions were gleaned from direct testing of people's DNA.

Though the researchers now know the proportion of the variation in intelligence that is likely to be a result of genes, they do not know which genes are likely to be most important.

""It could be many thousands,"" said Deary.

17-11-003_telegraph,2011-02-16,Toddlers can recognise basic maths,"Toddlers recognise basic arithmetic by the time they are 18-months-old, according to new research. 

A team of scientists found infants of this age choose to watch videos that depict correct counting, rather than those where the sums do not add up. 

The vast majority of human cultures possess a routine for counting things and although this generally is not mastered until children are about four, the study demonstrates the principles are first learned in infancy. 

Professor Virginia Slaughter, of the University of Queensland, and colleagues said: ""These findings demonstrate that humans begin to learn to count earlier than previously thought, based on exposure to their cultural counting routine."" 

The study involved a series of experiments in which infants viewed different videos depicting six fish, with the correct version featuring a hand pointing to each fish in turn accompanied by verbal counting up to six and the other a hand wrongly moving between just two of the six fish with the same commentary. 

One test of 36 Australian infants found 18-month-olds, but not 15-month-olds, significantly preferred to watch the correct counting sequence. 

Prof Slaughter said: ""These results show infants start to acquire the abstract principles governing correct counting prior to producing any counting behaviour. 

""Children begin to count some time after age two and their skill develops over the next several years. 

But before then, infants witness many instances of counting demonstrated by parents and older siblings, or portrayed on television. 

""What, if anything, do very young children glean from this early exposure to counting? 

""Our data suggest that between the ages of 15 and 18 months, infants begin to learn the abstract principles governing correct counting via exposure to their cultural counting routine.

Blame their paracingulate sulcus.

Scientists have pinpointed this as the part of the brain key to distinguishing truth from reality.

They found that when it is underdeveloped, people are more likely to claim others' ideas Ð and stories Ð as their own.

But as they are unlikely to realise there is anything wrong with their memory, any plagiarism will be unintentional.

It could lead them to believe, for example, that the fantastical events in a story they heard in the pub actually happened to them.

Dr Jon Simons gave 53 men and women well-known word pairs such as 'Laurel and Hardy' or incomplete pairs such as 'Laurel and ?' and asked them to imagine the missing word.

Then, they or the scientist had to read the word pair aloud.

Later, the volunteers were asked to remember whether they had seen or imagined the second word of each pair and who read the words out.

Those with a well-developed paracingulate sulcus were right 85 per cent of the time, while those where it was underdeveloped were correct in only 75 per cent.

In a study scheduled to be published in the Journal of Neuroscience, researchers from Cambridge University tested 53 volunteers and found differences in their ability to distinguish between real or imagined memories.

The scientists then found a direct link between these results and the size of a specific area of the brain called the paracingulate sulcus, or PCS.

The PCS is one of the last regions of the brain to develop before birth, and the study found that people with a larger PCS were better at discerning real experiences from imagined ones.

""The memory differences we observed were quite striking. It is exciting to think that these individual differences in ability might have a basis in a simple brain folding variation,"" said Cambridge's Jon Simons, who led the research.

The findings may also help scientists understand more about schizophrenia, he said, because an inability to recognize what is real and what isn't is a hallmark of the disease.

""Hallucinations are often reported whereby, for example, someone hears a voice when nobody's there.

Difficulty distinguishing real from imagined information might be an explanation for such hallucinations,"" Simons said.

""The person might imagine the voice but misattribute it as coming from the outside world.""

Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder which affects 24 million people worldwide, according to World Health Organization data, yet relatively little is known of its causes.

""We've found evidence that suggests this particular (brain) region might be reduced in people with schizophrenia, and that this could be the beginning of an explanation for why these people experience hallucinations,"" Simons said in a telephone interview.

The 53 volunteers in the study first had brain scans which showed whether they had either a clear presence or absence of PCS in the left or right brain.

The researchers then showed them well-known word pairs -- such as ""Laurel and Hardy"" for example -- which were sometimes complete and sometimes had the second word blanked out.

The volunteers were then asked to remember whether they had seen a completed pair, or whether they had completed the pair in their own mind.

""What we're interested in linking next is whether individuals with schizophrenia who also have that reduction in the PCS are definitely more likely to experience hallucinations,"" Simons said, adding that his team is planning further research in the coming months.

15-11-001_bbcnews,2011-01-08,Obesity linked to money insecurity in affluent nations,"People in wealthy countries with ""free market"" economies are more likely to become obese, an Oxford University study says.

Money stresses in countries like the UK and US could explain their higher obesity levels, compared with countries such as Norway and Sweden.

The study, in Economic and Human Biology, compared obesity in 11 affluent countries from 1994 to 2004.

The researchers said the study showed obesity had ""social causes"".

Researchers set out to discover why Americans and Britons are heavier than Norwegians and Swedes.

Taking into account research into animal behaviour which shows that animals increase their food intake when faced with uncertainty, the Oxford researchers believed that stress could be a factor in causing people to overeat.

So they analysed data on obesity levels using 96 national surveys carried out over 10 years across a number of different countries.

They looked at 'market-liberal' countries including the US, UK, Canada and Australia.

These were compared with Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain and Sweden - which traditionally offer stronger social protection and higher levels of economic security.

 “The economic benefits of flexible and open markets come at a price to personal and public health.” - End Quote Professor Avner Offer Oxford University 

The study found that the more market-liberal countries stand out as having high levels of obesity - one-third more obesity on average - and higher rates of obesity growth.

This is true even when compared with other affluent countries with similar levels of incomes, the study says.

Social causes 

The USA had the highest levels of obesity (with a mean of around 30% obese), whereas Italy, with the lowest prevalence, had almost half the levels (around 17%).

Professor Avner Offer, lead study author and professor of economic history at the University of Oxford, said: ""Policies to reduce levels of obesity tend to focus on encouraging people to look after themselves but this study suggests that obesity has larger social causes. 

""The onset and increase of large-scale obesity began during the 1980s, and coincided with the rise of market-liberalism in the English-speaking countries. 

""It may be that the economic benefits of flexible and open markets come at a price to personal and public health which is rarely taken into account.

In a study in the journal Economics and Human Biology, Oxford University researchers found that Americans and Britons are much more likely to be obese than Norwegians and Swedes, and suggested that the stress of life in a competitive social system without a strong welfare state may cause people to overeat. 



""Policies to reduce levels of obesity tend to focus on encouraging people to look after themselves, but this study suggests that obesity has larger social causes,"" said Avner Offer, a professor of economic history who led the study.

""It may be that the economic benefits of flexible and open markets come at a price to personal and public health which is rarely taken into account.""

Offer's team looked at 11 wealthy countries and found that those with a liberal market regime -- with strong market incentives and relatively weak welfare states -- experienced one-third more obesity on average.

Comparing four ""market-liberal"" English-speaking countries -- the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia -- with seven relatively wealthy European countries that traditionally offer stronger social protection -- Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain and Sweden -- the team found that economic insecurity is strongly linked to levels of obesity.

Countries with higher levels of job and income security were associated with lower levels of obesity, the researchers said.

""Basically, our hypothesis is that market-liberal reforms have stimulated competition in both the work environment and in what we consume, and this has undermined personal stability and security,"" Offer said in a statement about the findings.

He also argued that the onset and increase of large-scale obesity began during the 1980s, coinciding with the rise of market-liberalism in the English-speaking countries.

The rise of obesity in wealthy societies has often been attributed to an increasingly ready supply of cheap, accessible, high-energy, pre-processed food in fast food outlets and supermarkets -- a phenomenon known as the ""fast food shock"" -- but Offer's team found that economic influences were greater.

The team measured fast food's impact by using a price index created by The Economist magazine which shows international variations in the cost of a McDonald's Big Mac hamburger.

They calculated that the availability of fast food had only about half as much of an effect on the prevalence of obesity as the effects of economic insecurity.

""The most powerful influence we have uncovered on levels of obesity is insecurity,"" they wrote in their study.

The researchers said they had only examined data at a national level and were now looking at data at an individual level to try to establish what drives people to overeat.","{""Economics and Human Biology"": 1, ""The Economist"": 1}","{""Avner Offer"": 1}","{""Economics and Human Biology"": 1, ""Oxford University"": 1, ""Economist"": 1, ""McDonald"": 1}","{""Avner Offer"": 1}","{""Economics and Human Biology"": 1, ""Oxford University"": 1, ""Economist"": 1, ""McDonald"": 1}"

The University of Edinburgh team said the protein, neurofacin, is crucial for maintaining the health and function of the segment of nerve fibres that controls transmission of messages within the brain.

The brain works like an electrical circuit, sending impulses along nerve fibres and when impulses from the brain are disrupted it can lead to an inability to control movement, characteristic of conditions such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and strokes.

Dr Matthew Nolan, of the university's Centre for Integrative Physiology, said: 'At any moment tens of thousands of electrical impulses are transmitting messages between nerve cells in our brains.

'Identifying proteins that are critical for the precise initiation of these impulses will help unravel the complexities of how brains work and may lead to new insights into how brains evolved.'

This leads to an inability to control movement, and muscles wasting away.

The brain works like an electrical circuit, sending impulses along nerve fibres in the same way that current is sent through wires.

These fibres can measure up to a metre, but the area covered by the segment of nerve that controls transmission of messages is no bigger than the width of a human hair.

Signal failure 

The scientists discovered that the protein Nfasc186 is crucial for maintaining the health and function of the segment of nerve fibres - called the axon initial segment (AIS) - that controls transmission of messages within the brain.

They found that the AIS and the protein within it are important in ensuring the nerve impulse has the right properties to convey the message as it should.

Professor Peter Brophy, director of the University of Edinburgh's Centre for Neuroregeneration, said: ""Knowing more about how signals in the brain work will help us better understand neurodegenerative disorders and why, when these illnesses strike, the brain can no longer send signals to parts of the body.""

Dr Matthew Nolan, of the university's Centre for Integrative Physiology, said: ""At any moment tens of thousands of electrical impulses are transmitting messages between nerve cells in our brains. 

""Identifying proteins that are critical for the precise initiation of these impulses will help unravel the complexities of how brains work and may lead to new insights into how brains evolved.""

15-11-023_scotsman,2011-12-09,Vitamin D link to MS grows,"A RARE variable gene which causes reduced levels of vitamin D appears to be directly linked to multiple sclerosis, according an Oxford University study.

UK and Canadian scientists identified the mutated gene in 35 parents of a child with MS and, in each case, the child inherited it.

The mutated gene affects a key enzyme which leads people with the variant to have lower levels of vitamin D, adding weight to the suggested link between vitamin D and MS.

The likelihood of this gene's transmission being unconnected to the MS is billions to one against, the researchers say.

Dr Doug Brown, head of biomedical research at the MS Society, said: ""This is an important development and shines more light on the potential role of vitamin D deficiency on increasing the risk of developing MS.""",,"{""Doug Brown"": 1}","{""Oxford University"": 1, ""MS"": 1, ""the MS Society"": 1}",,"{""Oxford University"": 1, ""MS"": 3, ""the MS Society"": 1}"
15-11-023_bbcnews,2011-12-08,Rare gene links vitamin D and multiple sclerosis,"A rare genetic variant which causes reduced levels of vitamin D appears to be directly linked to multiple sclerosis, says an Oxford University study.

UK and Canadian scientists identified the mutated gene in 35 parents of a child with MS and, in each case, the child inherited it.

Researchers say this adds weight to suggestions of a link between vitamin D deficiency and MS.

The study is in Annals of Neurology.

Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord).

Although the cause of MS is not yet conclusively known, both genetic and environmental factors and their interactions are known to be important.

Oxford University researchers, along with Canadian colleagues at the University of Ottawa, University of British Columbia and McGill University, set out to look for rare genetic changes that could explain strong clustering of MS cases in some families in an existing Canadian study.

They sequenced all the gene-coding regions in the genomes of 43 individuals selected from families with four or more members with MS. 

The team compared the DNA changes they found against existing databases, and identified a change in the gene CYP27B1 as being important.

When people inherit two copies of this gene they develop a genetic form of rickets - a disease caused by vitamin D deficiency.

Just one copy of the mutated CYP27B1 gene affects a key enzyme which leads people with it to have lower levels of vitamin D.

Overwhelming odds 

The researchers then looked for the rare gene variant in over 3,000 families of unaffected parents with a child with MS. 

They found 35 parents who carried one copy of this variant along with one normal copy. 

In every one of these 35 cases, the child with MS had inherited the mutated version of the gene.

The likelihood of this gene's transmission being unconnected to the MS is billions to one against, say the researchers.

Prof George Ebers, lead study author at Oxford University, says the odds are overwhelming.

""All 35 children inheriting the variant is like flipping a coin 35 times and getting 35 heads, entailing odds of 32 billion to one against.""

He added: ""This type of finding has not been seen in any complex disease.

The uniform transmission of a variant to offspring with MS is without precedent but there will have been interaction with other factors.""

Prof Ebers believes that this new evidence adds to previous observational studies which have suggested that sunshine levels around the globe - the body needs sunshine to generate vitamin D - are linked to MS.

He maintained that there was now enough evidence to carry out large-scale studies of vitamin D supplements for preventing multiple sclerosis.

""It would be important particularly in countries like Scotland and the rest of the UK where sunshine levels are low for large parts of the year.

Scotland has the greatest incidence of multiple sclerosis of any country in the world.""

Dr Doug Brown, head of biomedical research at the MS Society, called it an important development.

""This shines more light on the potential role of vitamin D deficiency on increasing the risk of developing MS. 

""This research is gathering momentum and will be the subject of discussion at an international expert meeting in the USA this month, the outcomes of which will shape future research that will give us the answers we so desperately need about the potential risks and benefit of vitamin D supplementation.""

Paul Comer, from the charity MS Trust, said the research strengthened the case for vitamin D being one potential contributory cause of MS.

""Current opinion suggests that a combination of genetic predisposition, environmental factors such as exposure to sunlight and possibly some sort of trigger, such as a viral infection, interact in some way to start the development of MS.

""We welcome any research that clarifies the interplay between these factors.

This is another step towards finding ways to reduce the risk of developing MS, but it is likely to be some years yet before we can gauge the significance of vitamin D deficiency to MS.""","{""Annals of Neurology"": 1}","{""George Ebers"": 1, ""Ebers"": 1, ""Doug Brown"": 1, ""Paul Comer"": 1}","{""Oxford University"": 3, ""Annals of Neurology"": 1, ""the University of Ottawa, University of British Columbia"": 1, ""McGill University"": 1, ""MS"": 4, ""the MS Society"": 1, ""MS Trust"": 1}","{""George Ebers"": 1, ""Ebers"": 1}","{""Oxford University"": 3, ""MS"": 10, ""Annals of Neurology"": 1, ""the University of Ottawa, University of British Columbia"": 1, ""McGill University"": 1, ""the MS Society"": 1, ""MS Trust"": 1}"
03-11-024_dailymail,2011-08-10,VIDEO TEST 'GIVES BETTER CHANCE OF IVF SUCCESS',"A video technique that may significantly boost a woman's odds of having a baby could soon be available.

The test would provide doctors with a quick and accurate way of choosing the strongest embryos for IVF treatment.

This would cut the chances of miscarriage and, it is hoped, help countless couples achieve their dream of starting a family.

It would also reduce the financial cost of treatment and the emotional heartache of repeatedly failing to become pregnant.

Professor Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz, one of the Cambridge University researchers who devised the technique, believes it will be particularly useful for older women.

She told the Daily Mail: 'More and more women are deciding to have their babies in their 30s and 40s.

For them it's an extremely important option but most women in the UK could benefit.'

The professor experimented on mice but she hopes the technique will be tried out in two leading IVF clinics within months.

Doctors currently use a variety of techniques to pick the best embryos for IVF treatment but they are laborious and far from perfect.

In contrast, Professor Zernicka-Goetz's technique takes just a couple of hours.

Using time-lapse videos and a technique called particle imaging velocitometry, she found that the state of the cytoplasm, the jelly-like 'white' of the egg, in the two hours after fertilisation is crucial.

Pulses of movement sweep through the cytoplasm and the faster they move, the more likely a pregnancy will result.

In tests on mice, 87.5 per cent of the fertilised eggs with the quickest pulses went on to produce baby mice, compared with just 32 per cent of those with slow pulses, the journal Nature Communications reports.

The professor said: 'That's a huge difference. It's not just two-fold, it's three-fold.'



The cytoplasm in women's eggs also pulse after fertilisation. While the professor cannot be sure that the rate will also correspond with humans, she is optimistic.

The technique would be carried out in the test tube, shortly after the sperm fertilises the egg, and well before the resulting embryo is implanted in the woman's womb.

She added that the emotional benefits would be 'incredible'.

'You would not have to do it over and over again but rather do it better and once and be happy at the end of it.'

Fertility expert Allan Pacey described the research as 'elegant' but said that technique would need to be simplified or automated if it were to be used in busy clinics.","{""Daily Mail"": 1, ""Nature Communications"": 1}","{""Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz"": 1, ""Zernicka-Goetz's"": 1, ""Allan Pacey"": 1}","{""Cambridge University"": 1, ""the Daily Mail"": 1, ""Nature Communications"": 1}","{""Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz"": 1, ""Zernicka-Goetz's"": 1}","{""Cambridge University"": 1, ""Nature Communications"": 1}"

03-11-024_metro,2011-08-10,Spot the best embryos 'to improve IVF',"THE number of failed IVF treatments could be cut by a new technique which identifies the strongest embryos.

The non-invasive method of choosing the most robust organism to implant into a woman will ensure a better chance of a successful live birth, say researchers.

IVF success rates currently stand at about 30 per cent and a failed round of treatment is often traumatic for the potential mother.

But by studying the movement of eggs soon after fertilisation to predict survival chances Cambridge University scientists are confident success rates will rise.

Embryos are normally implanted after two or three days in culture. But about half of all human embryos stop developing after five days - and women are often implanted with many embryos at once, which can lead to multiple pregnancies.

'Choosing the best embryo to implant not only decreases the risks associated with multiple embryo transfers but also potentially minimises the number of rounds of IVF that potential mothers must go through,' said Prof Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz.

'This saves prospective parents both the trauma and cost of the IVF experiences,' she added.

08-11-026_dailymail,2011-11-25,FIRST-TIME MOTHERS WHO OPT FOR HOME BIRTH FACE TRIPLE THE RISK OF PROBLEMS,"FIRST-TIME mothers who opt for a home birth are almost three times more likely to have a baby who dies or suffers brain damage, says a major report.

It also found that traditional maternity units in hospital are the safest place for women to have their first child.

The comprehensive report into where mothers give birth in England found that first-time mothers were 2.8 times more likely to suffer serious problems at home than in hospital obstetric units.

These included the death of the child and injuries to its upper arms or shoulders.

Almost half of women who chose to give birth at home had to be transferred to a hospital because of complications during labour.

Such emergencies require intense medical attention, and are linked to trauma at birth or the baby becoming distressed or deprived of oxygen, potentially causing brain damage.

The study also found that 36 per cent of women using birthing units Ð maternity units sometimes outside hospital grounds which are run by midwives Ð had to be transferred to hospital when problems arose.

Dr Tony Falconer, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: 'This study has shown that first-time mothers wishing to deliver at home have an increased risk for their babies, thus raising questions about the right birth location for this group of women.

'In addition, having to transfer 36 per cent of mothers from a free-standing midwifery unit to obstetric units raises many issues.'

The Birthplace in England study, published in the British Medical Journal, compared data for 65,000 women deemed at low risk of complications who planned to give birth either in a hospital maternity department, at home or in a midwife-led birthing unit.

Professor Peter Brocklehurst, who led the study at Oxford University but has since moved to University College London, believes women should have a choice over where they have their babies.

He said: 'There is an increase in risk for first-time mums planning home births, but poor outcomes for the baby are still uncommon.'

Serious problems are rare for babies whose birth was planned in a maternity unit Ð occurring just 3.5 times for every 1,000 deliveries. 

But the research shows the rate rises to 9.5 per 1,000 babies if the birth is planned at home.

In England last year, 2.5 per cent of mothers had a home birth Ð a slight fall on the previous year Ð with nine out of ten births occurring in hospital.

Women who chose to give birth in a consultant-led hospital maternity unit had a higher chance of an intervention Ð such as a caesarean, delivery using ventouse or forceps, or being given an epidural.

Only 58 per cent of these women had a natural birth without any intervention, compared with 88 per cent of women giving birth at home and three-quarters of women in a midwife-led unit. 

Cathy Warwick, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Midwives, said: 'For women who do not have complications, planning to give birth at home or in a midwife-led unit is as safe as planning to give birth in a consultant-led unit.

'Where a woman is considering birth at home she needs to be aware that there is a chance that wherever she gives birth the baby may have a poor outcome, and at home this chance is increased.'

Mary Newburn, head of research and information at NCT, the UK's largest charity for parents, said: 'For first-time mothers planning a home birth there was a small increase in poor outcomes, but a greater chance of giving birth without interventions. 

Parents should have this explained to them, so they can then make up their minds where they would like to plan to have their baby.'

The researchers found there was no increased risk for second or subsequent babies whose mothers chose home birth Ð the finding only applied to first-time mothers.

Public Health Minister Anne Milton said: 'This report gives valuable evidence on which to base decisions about services.'

08-11-026_sun,2011-11-25,HOME BIRTH RISKS UP FOR NEW MUMS,"FIRST-TIME mums are three times more likely to lose their baby if they give birth at home, a study reveals.

The danger of stillbirth, death in the first week, brain injury and upper arm and shoulder fractures are all increased.

But researchers also discovered that giving birth in Britain was ""generally very safe"" - and experts agreed home birth had ""much to recommend"" it.

The study compared data for almost 65,000 mums-to-be at low-risk of complications who planned to give birth in hospital, at home or at a midwife-led unit.

It found serious problems occurred in 9.5 of every 1,000 home births compared to a figure of 3.5 in a hospital obstetrics unit.

The problems at home were linked to trauma during labour, or the baby becoming distressed leading to deprivation of oxygen.

Almost HALF of first-time mums were taken to hospital when complications developed.

The researchers said the fact women can be transferred is one reason why home births are considered safe.

Mums delivering their first babies in hospitals or other midwife-run units faced NO increased risk, the study found.

The same was true for mums having a second or subsequent baby at home.

Professor Peter Brocklehurst, who led the Oxford University Birthplace in England study, said: ""There is an increase in risk for firsttime mums planning home births.

""But poor outcomes for the baby are still uncommon.

08-11-026_times,2011-11-25,Home births 'twice as risky' as hospital for first-time mothers;,"First-time mothers who plan to give birth at home are twice as likely to have a baby who dies or is seriously harmed as those giving birth in hospital, a landmark study has concluded.

But after the first child, births at home and midwife-led units are just as safe, convenient and less invasive for women at low risk, the study found, prompting calls for hundreds of thousands of women to have their children outside traditional labour wards.

Midwives said that the results meant a ""seismic shift"" to assumptions about maternity care after the most comprehensive analysis of the relative safety of births in hospital, midwife-led units and at home. 

The study of 65,000 lowrisk women, carried out by the University of Oxford, is the first to group women by where they tried to give birth, rather than where they ended up.

Birth proved generally very safe for women without health problems, with less than 0.5 per cent of babies having problems such as death, brain damage, breathing difficulty or broken bones.

First-time mothers trying to give birth at home were much more likely to suffer such problems, which were seen in 9.3 births per 1,000, compared with 5.3 per 1,000 for first-time births in hospital. 

For women who began labour without complication, the difference was even greater, at 9.5 per 1,000 at home compared with 3.5 per 1,000 in hospital.

Peter Brocklehurst, who led the study, published in the British Medical Journal, said it was unclear what caused the increased risk. 

""For women having subsequent babies there was no difference,"" he said. 

""Mothers will need to balance the increase in risk of uncommon outcomes for the baby, some of which are mild and temporary and some of which are serious, against the very much greater likelihood of having a 'normal' birth in a hospital.""

First-time mothers who try to give birth outside hospital are also much more likely to be admitted later because of problems during labour. 

Of those starting birth at home, 45 per cent ended up in hospital, usually because labour was taking too long. 

Midwife-led units, which often exclude doctors and aim to give women a birth without interventions such as epidurals, forceps or Caesarean section, proved generally as safe as hospitals. 

They provided a normal birth about 80 per cent of the time, compared with 88 per cent at home and 58 per cent among low-risk women in hospital.

Louise Silverton, deputy general secretary of the Royal College of Midwives, who was involved in the study, said that it should spur the creation of more midwife-led units. 

Currently, only two thirds of trusts have them and more than 90 per cent of the 700,000 births in Britain a year are in hospital.

""Say it's a third of women out of obstetric units into midwife-led units or home, that's going to make labour wards much nicer to be in,"" she said. 

""At the moment it's like being on a production line. 

It will allow them to focus on women who are high risk.""

The RCM said that there should be ""a seismic shift in the way maternity services are provided"" because the current system wastes taxpayers' money. 

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said this year that about a third of women did not need a doctor during birth, recommending that dozens of maternity wards be converted to midwife-led centres.

'I wanted a familiar environment'

Case study

Emma Thomas decided on a home birth for her first child in 2001. 

""I wanted to be in a familiar environment and one I felt safe and happy in,"" she said (Chris Smyth writes).

""I laboured all night and I didn't progress .

 I called the midwife at 8pm, they stayed all that night. 

At 11am they were listening to the baby's heartbeat and it wasn't as strong as it should be.""

 Ms Thomas agreed to go into hospital. 

The forceps delivery was ""gentle"" but she had to stay in for two days with exhaustion. 

Her daughter was fine.

Three years later when she had her first son, Ms Thomas, 39, from Edinburgh, wanted to try another home birth.

 ""It was textbook,"" she said. ""I called the midwife at 6 or 7pm and he was born at 11.30pm. 

I felt glad I had him at home. 

It was so starkly clinical in the hospital.""

For her third child, in 2009, she also had a home birth but it was ""much harder"".

08-11-026_guardian,2011-11-25,"Home births as safe as hospital for second baby, study shows","Giving birth at home or in a midwife-led birth centre is just as safe as going into hospital for women who already have a child, but there is a slight extra risk of problems for the babies of first-time mothers who opt to stay at home, according to a study of more than 64,500 births in England.

Women with low-risk pregnancies should have the right to choose where they want to give birth, conclude the authors of the research.

Professor Peter Brocklehurst of the University of Oxford and colleagues in the Birthplace in England group found that adverse outcomes for the baby - including stillbirth, death soon after birth and oxygen deprivation - were rare in women who had low-risk pregnancies. 

Overall, they happened in 4.3 births per 1,000 and there were no significant differences between hospital obstetric units and elsewhere.

There was, however, an increase in the risk of an adverse outcome for babies of first-time mothers at home - 9.3 per 1,000 births, compared with 5.3 in hospital and 4.5 in a dedicated birth centre.

The slightly worse outcomes at home for first-timers are unexplained. 

""We don't know which aspects of the care or the site contributed to this,"" said Brocklehurst. 

It could be to do with the sort of women who chose home birth, the midwife's experience, problems in transferring to hospital in an emergency or something else.

First-time mothers who started at home were much more likely to be transferred to hospital - 45% were moved, compared with less than 12% of women who had given birth before.

The risks for the baby dropped dramatically for women having their second or subsequent child, to 2.3 per 1,000 at home, 2.7 in a midwifery unit and 3.3 in hospital.

The study, published in the British Medical Journal, found those who planned to give birth at home or in a birth centre and at least started their care there were far less likely to have interventions such as caesarean sections, epidurals for pain relief and forceps deliveries. 

More than 11% of women whose care began in hospital had a caesarean, compared with 2.8% of those who began at home.

The authors say their findings have implications for planning NHS maternity care. Only 4% of women give birth at home and midwife-led birth centres are available in only half the areas of England.

""These results will enable women and their partners to have informed discussions with health professionals in relation to clinical outcomes and planned place of birth,"" say the authors.

 ""For policy makers, the results are important to inform decisions about service provision and commissioning.""

The National Childbirth Trust, a charity that supports parents, said pregnant women and their partners should have all options available.

""Different settings appeal to different people, and if a woman feels comfortable and secure in the environment she and her partner have chosen, she is likely to feel more in control during birth,"" said spokeswoman Mary Newburn.

Doctors warned that for women having their first babies, these factors should be taken into account when choosing where to give birth. 

However the research found that women having their second or third babies, who were classed as low risk, were just as safe at home or in a midwife-only unit as they were in a hospital unit with specialist obstetricians. 

Home births were cheaper for the NHS to provide and doctors said they should be encouraged for women having their second or third babies who had straightforward first births and healthy pregnancies. 

Midwifery leaders said the landmark study would strengthen calls for changes to be made to NHS services to allow more women to give birth in midwife-only units or at home. 

The research was conducted by Oxford University involving more than 65,500 births classified as low risk. 

It found that rates of complications affecting the baby including stillbirth after the start of labour, the baby dying within the first week of birth, brain injury, fractures to the upper arm or shoulder during birth, and faeces in the lungs, were higher for first time mothers. 

There were 9.5 such complications per 1,000 births for first time mothers having their baby at home, compared with 3.5 per 1,000 births to first time mothers in hospital. 

There was no increased risk for babies whose birth was planned at units led by midwives, either ones that stand alone in the community or which are attached to a hospital, according to the report, published in the British Medical Journal.

The researchers stressed that giving birth is generally very safe as 250 babies suffered complications from the 64,538 births in the study. 

Only 58 per cent of women in hospital had a natural birth without any intervention, compared to 88 per cent of women who opted for a birth at home and 76 per cent to 83 per cent of women who chose a midwife-led unit. 

Professor Peter Brocklehurst, who led the study at Oxford, but has since moved to University College London (UCL), said adverse events are very uncommon. 

""For every 1,000 women, 995 babies would have a completely normal outcome,"" he said. 

Prof Brocklehurst added: ""These results should reassure pregnant women planning their birth that they can make informed decisions about where they'd most like the birth to happen, knowing that giving birth in England is generally very safe. 

""There is an increase in risk for first-time mums planning home births, but poor outcomes for the baby are still uncommon."" 

He said the reason why babies born to first time mothers at home suffered more complications is not known. 

Maureen Treadwell, of the Birth Trauma Association, said: ""These findings are useful but are based on a study of only 5,000 women in each type of midwifery unit and do not tell us how many babies died or were brain damaged in each group."" 

She feared that the government will use the findings as 'an excuse' to restrict women's choices to midwife-led units or home if they were classed as low risk, in order to save money. 

The study showed that a home birth cost £310 less than one in an obstetric unit in hospital, while a birth in a midwife-led unit was £130 cheaper. 

Cathy Warwick, chief executive and general secretary of the RCM added: ""Where a woman having her first baby is considering birth at home, she needs to be aware that whilst the vast majority of babies will be well, there is a chance that wherever she gives birth, the baby may have a poor outcome and at home this chance is slightly increased. 

""However, the need for medical interventions in labour, such as the need for pain relief, remains less than in a consultant-led unit."" 

Dr Tony Falconer, President of the Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists (RCOG) said: ""The RCOG has always supported appropriately selected home birth but this study has shown that first-time mothers wishing to deliver at home have an increased risk of poor outcomes for their babies thus raising questions about the right birth location for this group of women. 

""In addition, the high transfer rates from free-standing midwifery units and midwifery units alongside obstetric units, for first-time mothers pose serious logistical problems. 

""The case is different for mothers with no complications in their subsequent pregnancies delivering at home or in a midwifery unit. There is therefore a need to expand these facilities with appropriate midwifery staffing to improve women's choices. 

""This study supports the concept of configuring maternity services differently and the expansion of midwifery units should occur."" 

Public Health Minister Anne Milton said: ""Every woman should receive the highest quality maternity care. 

This study will help NHS organisations around the country design excellent maternity services, based on what women want and need. 

""This report gives valuable evidence on which to base decisions about the design of services, including the opportunities for women to choose midwife-led care in both free-standing and alongside midwife-led units.

08-11-026_independent,2011-11-25,Home births safe as hospital births for second babies;,"Home births are as safe as hospital births for second and subsequent babies, a new study has found.

Researchers from Oxford University who studied 65,000 low-risk women found that hospital obstetric units are safer than home births for first babies - but that the chances of a normal birth are lower in hospital, owing to greater use of interventions.

For second and subsequent babies, home births were as safe as hospital - and cheaper. The extra risk of a home birth applied only to first babies.

First-time mothers were nearly three times more likely to have an ""adverse outcome"" ranging from death of the baby to injuries to the upper arm or shoulder during delivery, if the birth was planned at home rather than in a hospital obstetric unit.

There was no increased risk for first babies whose birth was planned at a unit led by a midwife. 

These units, which try to combine the best elements of home and hospital, fared well in the study but campaigners say they are under threat, despite their lower running costs, as NHS trusts scale back. 

Cathy Warwick, general secretary of the Royal College of Midwives, said the ""ground-breaking research"" should influence planning across the country.

""There needs to be a seismic shift in the way maternity services are provided.

The [current system] wastes taxpayers' money. 

The Government has called for the NHS to deliver more for less and this is exactly what an increase in homebirths and midwifeled services will deliver.""

08-11-026_scotsman,2011-11-25,Risk triples for babies if first-time mothers choose home birth,"First-time mothers who choose to give birth at home are almost three times more likely to have a baby who suffers a bad outcome including death or brain damage, new research shows.

A study of almost 65,000 births found that babies born to women giving birth for the first time were 2.8 times more likely to suffer serious problems if they had a home birth compared to those born in hospital obstetric units.

Problems include stillbirth after the start of labour, the baby dying within the first week of birth, brain injury, fractures to the upper arm or shoulder during birth, and faeces in the lung, which can require intense medical attention.

But the researchers, writing in the British Medical Journal, said overall their findings showed that the number of serious complications was low, and women should be given a choice of where to give birth.

Serious adverse outcomes for the baby are rare, the study found, occurring just 3.5 times for every 1,000 babies whose births were planned in an obstetric unit.

But this figure rises to 9.5 per 1,000 babies if the first-time mother chooses a home birth. 

These figures relate to women who have had a low-risk pregnancy and who did not have any complications at the start of labour. 

The researchers, from Oxford University, found there was no increased risk for babies whose birth was planned at units led by midwives.

There was also no increased risk for second or subsequent babies whose mothers planned a home birth - the finding only applied to first-time mothers.

The researchers stressed that giving birth was generally very safe. For all the women studied, the risk of harm to the baby was 4.3 per 1,000 births.

But the researchers did find women had a higher chance of an intervention - such as Caesarean, ventouse or forceps delivery, or epidural - if they chose to give birth in an obstetric unit.

Professor Peter Brocklehurst, who led the study, said adverse events were very uncommon. 

""For every 1,000 women, 995 babies would have a completely normal outcome,"" he said.

While the study was based on births in England, Prof Brocklehurst said the results would be applicable across the UK, including Scotland.

""Obviously, Scotland and Wales have issues in terms of how far some women live away from hospitals,"" he said.

He said that how remoteness affects birth outcomes was not clear, as women giving birth in midwifery units would also have to travel to obstetric units if they suffered complications - but they did not show an increase in adverse incidents.

""We don't know why we have seen this excess but we can only begin to speculate. 

It may be that the transport mechanisms are better from midwifery units than they are from home, or anecdotally some people have suggested they are worse.

 So it is difficult to know what the problem is.""

Gillian Smith, Scottish director of the Royal College of Midwives, said they would look at the research and how it would apply in Scotland. 

But she expressed concern that it could be used by those wishing to push women away from home births.

""The number [of adverse incidents] is very low and it is important that we remember that,"" she said.

The research, by Edinburgh and Cambridge universities, should help predict the appearance of new diseases.

The scientists wanted to understand how viruses such as bird flu infect distant species like humans.

They found they were better able to infect species closely related to their typical target species than species that were distantly related.

However, the research also suggested that when diseases make a big leap they may then spread easily in species closely related to the new victim, regardless of how closely related these are to the original target species.

Dr Ben Longdon, of Edinburgh University's school of biological sciences, who led the study, said: ""Emerging diseases such as Sars, HIV and some types of flu have all got into humans from other species.

""Understanding how diseases jump between different species is essential if we want to predict the appearance of new diseases in the future.""

By infecting more than 50 species of flies with three different viruses, the researchers showed that species closely related to a virus's usual target species were more susceptible than distantly related flies. 

They also showed that groups of flies that were closely related were similarly susceptible to the same viruses.

Facial expressions have been referred to as the ""universal language of emotion"", with the suggestion that people from different cultures share ideas about what someone is feeling based on their features.

But a study by Glasgow University shows this might not be the case, and the expressions we use could be interpreted very differently depending on where someone is from.

Researchers studied 15 Chinese people and 15 Caucasians living in Glasgow who were asked for their opinions on what faces expressed what emotions in computer-generated pictures.

They were shown emotion-neutral faces that were randomly altered on a computer screen.

They then categorised the facial expressions as happy, sad, surprised, fearful, disgusted or angry.

Their responses allowed the researchers to identify the expressive features that participants associated with each emotion.

03-11-011_dailymail,2011-03-03,DIABETES IN MIDDLE AGE 'CAN REDUCE YOUR LIFE,"HAVING diabetes in middle age will cut your life short by an average of six years, say researchers.

For the first time, a study has calculated the reduction in life expectancy from having type 2 diabetes, the kind linked to being overweight in middle age.

Diabetes is known to double the risk of heart attacks and strokes, but the new findings show people with type 2 diabetes are also at greater risk of dying from cancer, infection and mental disorders.

More than 2.5million Britons have diabetes, with 800,000 being unaware of the condition.

Scientists from the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration Ð co-ordinated by the University of Cambridge Ð analysed data on 820,900 people, each of whom was monitored for about a decade.

Even after accounting for other risk factors such as age, sex, obesity and smoking, the researchers found people with diabetes were at increased risk of death from several common cancers, infections, mental disorders, and liver, digestive, kidney and lung diseases. About 60 per cent of the reduced life expectancy in people with diabetes is attributable to blood vessel diseases Ð such as heart attacks and strokes.

Only a small part of these associations are explained by obesity, blood pressure, or high levels of fat in the blood Ð conditions which often co-exist with diabetes.

The study, involving more than 250 scientists from 25 countries, also suggests people with diabetes may be at increased risk of death from intentional self-harm Ð a finding which the scientists say requires further study, including investigation of a possible link between diabetes and depression.

It was funded by the Medical Research Council, British Heart Foundation and Pfizer, and is published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Researcher Naveed Sattar, of the University of Glasgow, said: 'The findings not only show the extensive range of complications linked to diabetes, but also the importance of raised sugar levels, as opposed to cholesterol and blood pressure to such complications.

'Overall, the findings should helpÊincentivise diabetes prevention in those at high risk.

 There is also some good news here.

'We show that a halving of the risk of premature death in patients with diabetes compared toÊthose without, over the last four decades, is almost certainly linked to betterÊtreatment in diabetes patients.'

Professor Stephen Holgate, chairman of an MRC research board, said: 'Preventing diabetes becomes that much easier when we have a complete picture of the debilitating effect it has across the body and we know what steps to take to mitigate the damage.'","{""the New England Journal of Medicine"": 1}","{""Naveed Sattar"": 1, ""Stephen Holgate"": 1}","{""the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration"": 1, ""the University of Cambridge"": 1, ""the Medical Research Council"": 1, ""British Heart Foundation"": 1, ""Pfizer"": 1, ""the New England Journal of Medicine"": 1, ""the University of Glasgow"": 1, ""MRC"": 1}","{""Naveed Sattar"": 1}","{""the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration"": 1, ""the University of Cambridge"": 1, ""the Medical Research Council"": 1, ""British Heart Foundation"": 1, ""Pfizer"": 1, ""the New England Journal of Medicine"": 1, ""the University of Glasgow"": 1, ""MRC"": 1}"
03-11-011_guardian,2011-03-03,Study: 50-year-old with diabetes dies 6 yrs sooner,"A 50-year-old with diabetes dies six years sooner than someone without the disease, and not just from a heart attack or a stroke, new research suggests. 

The large international effort to measure diabetes' toll found the disease also raises the risk of dying prematurely from a host of other ailments, even breast cancer and pneumonia. 

""It's quite a wide sweep of conditions,"" said Dr. John Danesh of Cambridge University in Britain, who led the team of researchers. 

While most people think of heart problems, diabetes surprisingly ""appears to be associated with a much broader range of health implications than previously suspected."" 

Putting the six years lost in context, he said, long-term smoking shortens life by 10 years. 

The analysis used pooled medical information for 820,900 people from nearly 100 studies done mostly in Europe and North America.

The results are published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. 

Diabetes, the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S., affects about 26 million Americans, or 8 percent, including 7 million who haven't been diagnosed.

 Most in the study were thought to have the most common kind — Type 2 — which occurs when the body makes too little insulin or cannot use what it does make to regulate blood sugar. 

High blood sugar can damage nerves and blood vessels, and is a major cause of heart disease. 

The new research didn't include those who had heart disease when they were first enrolled. 

Participants were followed on average for 13½ years, and there more than 123,000 deaths. 

Overall, death rates from various causes were higher for those with diabetes than those without. 

The researchers took into account other risk factors that could influence the results: age, gender, smoking and weight.

Type 2 diabetes is tied to obesity. 

They found that those with diabetes had double the risk of dying from a heart attack or stroke, compared to those without the disorder.

 But they also found that diabetics had a 25 percent higher risk of dying from cancer and were more likely to die from a variety of illnesses including infections, lung and kidney disease as well as falls. 

Exactly how diabetes raises those risks isn't clear, but in the case of infections, it could be that diabetes weakens the immune system, the researchers said.

 Diabetes can cause vision problems and loss of feeling in the legs, which may be the reason for falls, they said. 

Danesh said one intriguing finding was a higher risk of suicide in those with diabetes. Other research has linked diabetes with depression, he noted. 

The results are ""another reason to try to normalize blood glucose in people who have diabetes,"" through diet, exercise and medication, said Dr. Alvin Powers, a diabetes specialist at Vanderbilt University. ""There have been smaller studies that hinted at this but nothing where a study of this size looked at so many different outcomes."" 

Danesh and his colleagues also estimated diabetes' effect on life expectancy. 

They calculated that a 50-year-old diabetic without heart disease dies about six years earlier than someone without the disease, with 40 percent of the difference due to cancer and conditions other than heart disease. 

""It underscores the need to prevent diabetes,"" Danesh said. 

Previous studies have shown a possible link between diabetes and cancer. 

The new paper tied some, but not all, cancers; the increased risk ranged from 25 percent for breast cancer to double for liver cancer. 

Danesh said people with diabetes should get age-appropriate cancer screenings. 

Last year, a joint report from the American Diabetes Association and the American Cancer Society looked at the issue and said that it wasn't clear whether any connection was direct, indirect or perhaps because the two disorders share common risk factors, like obesity. 

The new research squares with that report's conclusion that ""there's a lot more we need to understand about diabetes and the link to cancer,"" said one of the authors, Dr. Richard Bergenstal of the International Diabetes Center at Park Nicollet in Minneapolis. He a former president of the diabetes group. 

While adding to the evidence, the study doesn't answer the question of why, he said. 

""Diabetes is a serious condition. 

We often don't quite think about it quite that way,"" Bergenstal said.

03-11-011_reuters,2011-03-02,Diabetics have higher risk of death from cancer,"Doctors know that diabetics have a higher than normal risk of dying of heart attacks or strokes, but new research on Wednesday showed that having diabetes also ups the risk of dying from many cancers and other diseases.

The findings shed light on the potential burden of disease that will build in the future as the number of cases of diabetes is predicted to rise dramatically in coming decades.

""These findings highlight even more the need to prevent diabetes and to understand it better,"" said Emanuele Di Angelantonio of Britain's Cambridge University, who worked on the study as part of an international collaboration.

""They show that diabetes is not only a cardiovascular risk factor, but is linked as well to other conditions.""

The research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), collated and analyzed data from 97 previous studies involving more than 820,000 people worldwide.

It found that being a diabetic hiked the odds of dying from cancer by 25 percent, and also heightened the risk of death from infection, kidney and liver disease.

The risk of death was only higher in people with poorly controlled diabetes, however, as indicated by high blood sugar levels after a fast.

Among the biggest cancer risks for diabetics were liver and pancreatic cancer, colorectal or bowel cancer, and lung cancer.

Diabetes is reaching epidemic levels with an estimated 280 million people, or 6.4 percent of the world's population, suffering from it and numbers predicted to rise further as obesity rates also increase.

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says up to a third of U.S. adults could have diabetes by 2050 they continue to gain weight and shun exercise.

Another study published this week found that millions of people with diabetes are undiagnosed or poorly treated, raising their risk of early death from heart disease and of serious complications like blindness and chronic kidney disease.

The Cambridge-led study found that aside from cancer and vascular diseases such as stroke, diabetes was also associated with deaths from many other causes including renal disease, liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mental disorders, pneumonia, other infectious diseases.

""A 50-year-old with diabetes died, on average, six years earlier than a counterpart without diabetes,"" said Cambridge University's John Danesh, who also worked on the study.

The study did not look at why these death rates were higher among diabetics, so the researchers could not say whether diabetes link was simply a proxy for generally poorer health.

""Preventing diabetes becomes that much easier when we have a complete picture of the debilitating effect it has across the body and we know what steps to take to mitigate the damage,"" said Stephen Holgate of Britain's Medical Research Council, which part-funded the study.

An international scientific team studied the family and a large group of patients in Finland.

They discovered a common gene which will now lead to new blood tests for families with a history of the disease.

One of the Gwent family, which has lost eight people to MND, said they felt ""relieved"" the gene had been found.

The findings of the international team, which also included scientists from Manchester University and University College London, have been published in the Neuron journal.

Funded by the Motor Neurone Disease Association, the research was conducted by taking blood and skin samples and conducting post-mortem examinations.

Genetic link 

Researchers found that the Welsh family and patients in Finland shared ""a changed genetic segment on the short arm of chromosome 9"".

The family, who did not want to be identified, traced their link to the disease back to the 1940s. 

Over the years they have lost many relatives to early onset motor neurone disease and also to a neurodegenerative illness known as Pick's disease.

Motor neurone disease is currently incurable and fatal, with an average survival of between two and five years.

Dr Huw Morris, based at the Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics at Cardiff University and the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, has worked with the family for the past 10 years.

He said that for most patients with motor neurone disease (MND) there is no risk to other family members, but some families are affected by ""familial MND"".

Dr Morris said the research was aimed at ""helping future generations"".

Breakthrough made 

""Six weeks ago we knew very little about the cause of this condition and now we know the primary cause of the disease within this family and similar families in other parts of the world,"" he said.

""To our surprise this is very common in familial MND so that a third of families around the world where many people have been affected carry this gene change.""

He added the breakthrough was ""the end of our long hunt for this gene"", but also marked ""the beginning of our search for therapies based on this discovery that can stop this brutal disease in its tracks"".

A member of the family said they ""have been waiting for years and years for this to be found"".

""I can't really describe how I felt when I heard that the cause of motor neuron disease in our family had been discovered,"" he said.

19-11-011_express,2011-09-30,Natural 'back-up system' that could save your heart,"THE heart has its own ""back-up system"" to help it function even if main arteries are blocked, scientists have found.

A series of tiny blood vessels called collaterals can act as a natural bypass system when arteries are clogged, a team at University College London revealed.

The collaterals connect to the larger vessels in the heart and carry blood around blockages.

Patients with lots of these vessels were found to have a 36 per cent reduced risk of death from heart disease, Britain's biggest killer.

Experts hope the find means they can create new ways to slash the number of deaths from cardiac disease.

Most heart attacks happen because of a gradual build-up of fatty material in main arteries.

Finding a way to avoid blockages would be a major breakthrough.

The researchers, who worked with colleagues from Germany and the US, said yesterday that collaterals could be a major new target for drugs and treatments.

The study, published online today in the European Heart Journal, pooled data from 12 trials involving 6,529 patients.

Lead author Dr Pascal Meier of UCL said: ""A growing body of research demonstrates that these vessels are protective and reduce mortality in patients with blocked coronary arteries.

We should find means to promote these natural bypass vessels.""

Maureen Talbot, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""These backup blood vessels seem to play a very important role in helping maintain blood supply to the heart, and this interesting research is encouraging.

13-11-011_dailymail,2011-06-27,A 'WONDER DRUG' THAT COULD KILL ALL TYPES OF CANCER,"A BREAST cancer 'wonder drug' could be turned into a universal weapon against tumours, British scientists said last night.

They have discovered a way of making a family of breast cancer pills effective against other cancers.

The finding could lead to new drugs that shrink many Ð or even all types Ð of tumour, the Newcastle University scientists said.

In addition, side-effects such as nausea and tiredness should be minimal.

The excitement centres on a family of cancer drugs known as PARP inhibitors, which affect the way tumour cells repair themselves.

These target hereditary forms of breast cancer, as well as ovarian prostate cancers and pancreatic tumours with the same rogue gene.

The drugs are of particular interest to doctors because they zero in on the tumour, and kill it without harming healthy cells.

This means patients suffer fewer side effects than they would with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, in which healthy cells are affected.

The drugs exploit the 'Achilles'' heel' of hereditary forms of breast cancer. This is caused by a flaw in a gene called BRCA1, which limits the cells' ability to repair damage their DNA.

Healthy cells have two ways of patching up damage Ð which allows them to breed, grow and spread Ð but cells in BRCA tumours only have one.

PARP inhibitors block this remaining pathway, stopping the tumour cells from multiplying, eventually leading them to die.

 Some breast, ovarian and prostate tumours have flawed BRCA genes Ð but account for a small proportion of all cancers.

The research would allow the drugs to be used on tumours which do not have this genetic flaw, by effectively 'recreating' the defect.

In experiments on mice with lung tumours the researchers showed that blocking a molecule called Cdk1 also stopped DNA repair.

When the animals were given a PARP inhibitor, it successfully shrunk their cancer, the journal Nature Medicine reports.

Researcher Professor Nicola Curtin said: 'Blocking Cdk1 compromises DNA repair in cancer cells, making them sensitive to PARP inhibitors.

'We were also able to show that this approach only targeted cancer cells.

'Now we need to develop an effective drug that can block Cdk1, so more patients can benefit from treatment with PARP inhibitors. 

It could be widely applicable, possibly universally.

'The very fact that the defect that makes cells vulnerable to PARP inhibitors can be recreated in lung cancer is pretty hopeful.

'It is very early days but it is exciting.'

13-11-011_express,2011-06-27,New drug to shrink tumours,"SCIENTISTS are a step closer to a new wonder drug to treat cancer.

Chemotherapy, radiotherapy or the need for surgery could become a thing of the past thanks to a new range of ""smart"" drugs known as PARP inhibitors which target cancer cells.

Their discovery three years ago was hailed as ground-breaking because of their ability to treat a third of patients with common forms of the disease including breast, prostate, skin, ovarian, womb and colon cancers.

The treatment was found to dramatically shrink tumours without harming surrounding healthy cells.

Now scientists at Newcastle University and Harvard in the US have found a way to use the treatment for any cancer by improving the range of PARP inhibitors by blocking a key component of the DNA repair process.

03-11-012_times,2011-03-02,Scientists hail stem cell breakthrough; Hope for drugs to fight motor neuron disease,"The use of embryonic stem cells in the battle against hereditary conditions such as motor neuron disease has been vindicated by new scientific advances, it was claimed last night.

Researchers in Edinburgh revealed that they had used embryonic stem cells to generate a range of human motor neurons in a laboratory dish, reproducing the variety that naturally occurs in the human body.

The ability to compare healthy and unhealthy human cells opens up the possibility of developing powerful drug treatments which could eventually slow down the impact of the disease.

Debilitating, distressing and fast-acting, MND usually kills its victims within four to five years of diagnosis.

The breakthrough was ""an important new system of scientific cooking"", said Professor Siddharthan Chandran of the University of Edinburgh.

""Within 12 months we will be talking about building systems and moving towards really powerful drug-testing tools for slowing down the disease.""

Motor neurons - nerve cells that send messages from the brain and spine to other parts of the body - differ in their make-up depending on where they are in the spinal cord.

They control muscle activity such as speaking, walking, swallowing and breathing.

In MND the apparently healthy cells break down, leading to paralysis and difficulties with those functions.

""MND is a problem of the motor nerves, but the important detail is that motor nerves come in many different 'flavours' and they respond at different speeds,"" said Professor Chandran, director of the Euan MacDonald Centre for Motor Neurone Disease Research.

""You need to create that range in a dish if you want to model that disease.

The use of embryonic stem cells gives us exactly that opportunity.""

Scientists believe that advances in stem cell technology represent an unprecedented opportunity to tackle hundreds of inherited diseases, including MND and haemophilia, which could prove as important for humanity as the conquest of infectious diseases over the past 200 years.

The use of embryonic stem cells, the result of embryonic cloning, has been bitterly opposed by the pro-life lobby.

In 2001, President Bush blocked the use of US government money to fund research on embryonic stem cell lines created after August 9, 2001.

The ban was revoked by President Obama in 2009.

In the past, drugs developed for MND and tested on animals have failed when used in human trials.

Professor Chandran said that the new procedure, developed in conjunction with the universities of Cambridge and Cardiff, held great promise.

""We can generate motor neuron cells from healthy people and develop cells from people who have inherited the disease,"" he said.

""With those materials in the laboratory, you can begin to think about drugs that work.""

03-11-012_scotsman,2011-03-02,Scots break new ground with nerve cell research,"SCOTTISH scientists have discovered a new way to create human motor nerve cells, in the hope of finding new treatments for patients with a devastating illness.

Researchers from Edinburgh University, working with colleagues in Cambridge and Cardiff, have created a range of motor neurons - the nerves cells that send messages from the brain and spine to other parts of the body - from human embryonic stem cells in the lab.

It is the first time researchers have been able to generate a variety of human motor neurons.

This is important because the cells differ in their make-up and properties, depending on where they are in the spinal cord.

The research, published in the journal Nature Communications, could help scientists better understand motor neurone disease.

The process will allow scientists to study why some motor neurons are more prone to disease than others.

They can use the cells they create to test new drugs, before deciding which compounds are worth developing into treatments ready for patient trials.

Motor neurons control muscle activity, such as speaking, walking, swallowing and breathing.

But in patients with motor neurone disease - a progressive and ultimately fatal disorder - these cells break down, leading to paralysis, and difficulty in speaking, breathing and swallowing.

Previously, scientists had been able to generate just one particular kind of motor neuron, which they did by using a substance called retinoic acid - a derivative of vitamin A.

For the latest study, scientists found a new process, using a different chemical, to generate a wider range of motor neurons.

11-11-004_dailymail,2011-08-16,HIDDEN TORMENT OF NUT ALLERGY CHILDREN,"CHILDREN with potentially deadly nut allergies are being bullied for being different, say researchers.

And their parents are stigmatised as 'neurotic and attention-seeking' by other parents, they found.

Relatives of some victims of the condition are even suspected of deliberately giving a child nuts to check they really are allergic.

Overall, the impact of a nut allergy is so great that it could be considered a disability, the Leicester University researchers found.

They interviewed 26 families from the Leicester area about their experiences.

Some children told how they were bullied by classmates, who taunted them about their allergy and threatened to trigger it.

Other youngsters were stigmatised at lunchtime, when they sat apart from other youngsters who had brought peanut butter sandwiches with them.

Some of the parents were so worried about their children coming into contact with peanuts that they stopped them from going to birthday parties or eating out.

Others felt they had no option but to hover over them at parties Ð when they experienced prejudice themselves.

The researchers said: 'Parents vividly described how not everyone accepted it as an authentic condition with potentially deadly implications, instead seeing it as a frivolous and self-indulgent fad invented and maintained by neurotic, attention-seeking people.

This meant that parents struggled to preserve their own identity as sensible, credible people who deserved to be taken seriously.'

Research leader Professor Mary Dixon-Woods said: 'In many ways nut allergy may be considered a form of disability because of the ways in which it imposes social barriers on participating fully in society.'

Nut allergies are on the rise, with up to one in 50 children in the UK allergic to peanuts.

This makes it the most common serious allergy.

Reactions can range from mild itching and rashes to life-threatening breathing problems which kill an average of seven children a year.

Nut allergies are usually diagnosed in the first two years of life and parents are told to keep their children away from all types of nuts and traces of nuts and to carry a 'pen' that holds a shot of adrenaline.

According to the study, which is published in the journal Chronic Illness, even family members could not always be trusted.

In some cases elderly relatives suffered memory lapses, but other relations were suspected of giving the children nuts just to check they really did have an allergy.

Professor Dixon-Woods said: 'Families of a child with a nut allergy are very well-briefed and know what to ask of the people they are visiting.

Our study shows, however, that sometimes people don't take always this advice very seriously and can be careless.'

But others defended parents of allergy-free children.

They said that often they are scared a child with an allergy will have a reaction when visiting their home.

In addition, while it is easy to avoid serving bagged nuts, even well-meaning friends can be unaware that nuts are a hidden ingredient in many foods.

JAMIE Berry's peanut allergy causes such concern to his mother that she accompanies him to all his friends' birthday parties.

Rachel Berry also takes a supply of nut-free food to the party, and even alternative prizes for games such as pass the parcel.

Jamie, six, can't eat ice lollies because many are produced in factories that use nuts.

When he has a reaction, his face becomes swollen and covered in a rash that closes his eyes.

Mrs Berry, 43, an accountant from Gloucestershire, said that while Jamie's school friends readily accept his allergy, some parents do not.

Mrs Berry, a member of charity Allergy UK, said: 'I do think that he is missing out on play dates Ð his little brother gets asked to more.

I know some mums have said that they'd love to have him round but they just can't cope with it.'","{""Chronic Illness"": 1}","{""Mary Dixon-Woods"": 1, ""Dixon-Woods"": 1, ""JAMIE"": 1, ""Berry"": 3, ""Rachel Berry"": 1, ""Jamie"": 2}","{""Leicester University"": 1, ""Allergy UK"": 1}","{""Mary Dixon-Woods"": 1, ""Dixon-Woods"": 2}","{""Leicester University"": 1}"
01-11-023_dailymail,2011-11-04,LOSE JUST 7LB AND YOU COULD ADD A YEAR TO YOUR LIFE,"... BUT ONLY IF YOU'RE MIDDLE-AGED AND OVERWEIGHT

BY JENNY HOPE MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT

OVERWEIGHT people who lose just seven pounds in weight could gain an extra year of life, a study has found.

However, to extend your time on Earth by 12 months, researchers warn that 'you have to sustain the weight loss for ever'.

The study also suggests that Weight Watchers and other commercial weight-loss programmes are better than GPs at helping obese patients shed the pounds.

The benefits include cutting the risk of diabetes and boosting life expectancy, says the research from Birmingham University.

A study of 740 British slimmers found that those who went to a commercial slimming group for three months lost twice as much weight as those who were given diet advice by their family doctor.

The average weight loss was best for those attending Weight Watchers sessions Ð who lost almost ten pounds (4.4kg) on average Ð and worst for those following GP advice, who lost around three pounds (1.4kg).

Nevertheless, overweight middle-aged people who lose around seven pounds and maintain their new weight would gain a year of life, said Dr Kate Jolly, senior lecturer in public health and epidemiology at Birmingham University.

She said patients seem to lose weight more successfully when their GPs send them to commercial sessions, paid for by the NHS, including Weight Watchers, Slimming World and Rosemary Conley.

They were also significantly cheaper, with a course of 12 one-hour group sessions costing around £55 Ð just slightly more than one 12-minute GP appointment.

Dr Jolly said the NHS-funded study analysed the effect on life expectancy of weight loss of around seven pounds (3.5kg) in a 14-stone 49-year-old Ð the average age of people taking part in the study.

She added: 'It shows that losing a fairly modest amount of weight is worthwhile, although the big challenge is maintaining the weight loss.

Many studies show that people tend to put it on again after a short period of time.'

Almost a third of people allocated to the Weight Watchers group achieved a 5 per cent drop in body weight Ð the level needed to cut the risk of developing diabetes.

In the study, published in the British Medical Journal, the obese and overweight participants were asked by their GPs to join several commercial weight loss programmes, or have counselling from GPs or pharmacists over 12 weeks.

Another group was given free vouchers for a local fitness centre.After one year, all those attending commercial sessions had lost significant amounts of weight, while counselling made little difference.

Attendance seemed to be the key factor, with people going more often to commercial sessions.

Dr Jolly said: 'GPs don't have the tools for helping patients lose weight consistently, but they were the reason these patients were nudged towards losing weight in the first place.'

Almost a quarter of adults in England are now classified as obese and around two-thirds of Primary Care Trusts in England and Wales already pay for patients to attend Weight Watchers courses.","{""public health and epidemiology"": 1, ""British Medical Journal"": 1}","{""Kate Jolly"": 1, ""Rosemary Conley"": 1, ""Jolly"": 2}","{""Weight Watchers"": 5, ""Birmingham University"": 2, ""NHS"": 2, ""Slimming World"": 1, ""GP"": 1, ""the British Medical Journal"": 1, ""Primary Care Trusts"": 1}","{""Jolly"": 1}","{""Birmingham University"": 2, ""Weight Watchers"": 4, ""GP"": 2, ""NHS"": 2, ""Slimming World"": 1, ""Primary Care Trusts"": 1}"

Research has found that signing up to private weight-loss clubs such as Slimming World and Rosemary Conley, beats getting ""ineffective"" diet and fitness counselling on the health service.

In fact, experts reckon the money currently shelled out on such NHS programmes would be much better spent on encouraging people to attend classes run by private companies.

The study, published in the British Medical Journal, involved 740 obese or overweight men and women from one NHS trust in Birmingham.

Divided into six groups, the participants attended either Weight Watchers, Slimming World, Rosemary Conley, NHS-run Size Down, one-to-one counselling in GP surgeries, or one-to-one pharmacy counselling sessions.

After 12 weeks, all six groups had lost weight - from an average of 3lb in the GP group to 9.7lb in Weight Watchers.

But at this point the NHS programmes proved no better than a control group of people exercising at a local fitness centre.

And after a year, all but the GP and pharmacy counselling groups had ""significant weight loss"".

In fact, those attending commerciallyrun groups typically lost an extra 5lb, exercised more and were more likely to actually turn up to the classes.

The study's authors, from the University of Birmingham, the Nursing and Midwifery Council and NHS South Birmingham, concluded: ""Commercially provided weight management services are more effective and cheaper than primary care-based services.""

But commercial weight loss programmes are more effective and cheaper than schemes run by the NHS.

Offering patients counselling in diet and fitness via GP surgeries or pharmacies is ""ineffective"", as are programmes run by NHS food advisers and dieticians, the researchers found.

They said NHS cash would be better spent on encouraging people to attend classes run by commercial companies such as Slimming World, Weight Watchers or Rosemary Conley.

The study, published online in the British Medical Journal, involved 740 obese or overweight men and women recruited from one NHS trust in Birmingham.

They were divided into six groups and attended either Weight Watchers, Slimming World, Rosemary Conley, a group-based NHS programme run by advisers and dieticians called Size Down, one-to-one counselling sessions in GP surgeries, or one to-one counselling in pharmacies.

A control group was provided with 12 vouchers for free entrance to a local fitness centre.

All the participants were assessed after 12 weeks and again after a year.

In the first 12 weeks, they lost an average of 3lb and their life expectancy was calculated to have increased by about a year.

But the NHS programmes were found to be no better than the control group (people exercising at a local fitness centre) at this point.

At the one year mark, all the programmes except the GP and pharmacy groups had resulted in ""significant weight loss"" - typically an extra 5lb.

People were also least likely to attend sessions held at GPs' surgeries.

A comparison of three commercial weight loss clubs - Weight Watchers, Rosemary Conley and Slimming World - with programmes provided by GPs, pharmacists and dieticians, has shown the private sector comprehensively beats the NHS when it comes to helping people slim.

The research was carried out in south Birmingham, where overweight patients selected by their GPs were offered the chance to be referred to a weight-loss programme paid for by the NHS.

Half of the 740 patients were referred to the commercial slimming clubs and half to NHS programmes.

The greatest weight loss achieved was 4.4 kgs after 12 weeks, for the patients allocated to Weight Watchers while the smallest was 1.4kgs for those allocated to their GPs.

After one year the Weight Watchers group was the only one to achieve significantly greater weight loss - 3.46kgs - than the control group.

Despite GPs' poorer results, their programme was the most expensive, at £112.73 per patient, compared with £76.87 for Weight Watchers (the price charged to the NHS).

The Rosemary Conley programme also cost £76.87 and Slimming World £71.37.

The study, by researchers from the University of Birmingham and published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) is one of the first to compare NHS and private weight-loss programmes.

Two Australian nutrition experts say in an editorial in the BMJ that, on the basis of the results, the NHS should consider contracting out weight-loss programmes to the private sector, rather than training its NHS staff to provide them, to give patients more choice and bring better results.

""It is not surprising that primary care is less able to deliver weight-loss programmes than commercial companies, given the lack of resources compared with an industry that has invested millions to refine its products.""

A key reason why the commercial companies scored greater success was that the patients allocated to them kept coming back week after week.

One in four adults in the UK is overweight or obese and 16 per cent are trying seriously to shed pounds at any one time.

Rosemary Conley claims 80,000 members in the UK and Weight Watchers 1.5 million worldwide.

A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ""The local NHS must think about which weight management service will work best, based on an individual patient's needs.""

Earlier research has shown that most people on a diet achieve their maximum weight loss after six to eight months.

It has been assumed this is a natural ""plateauing"" effect.

But evidence suggests that people find it hard to stick to a diet for longer than six months and that is why they stop losing weight.

01-11-023_reuters,2011-11-04,Commercial diet schemes better than doctors' help,"Commercial weight-loss programs such as Weight Watchers and Slimming World are more effective and cheaper than family doctor-based services led by specially trained staff, according to the findings of a study published on Friday.

With a global epidemic of obesity putting huge pressure on health budgets, researchers at Britain's Birmingham University wanted to compare the effectiveness of doctor-led weight loss programs against several well-known commercial schemes.

The results suggest that while commercial schemes generally help people to lose weight, doctor-led programs do not.

After 12 weeks, people in all the schemes studied had achieved significant weight loss, but the average loss ranged from the highest at 4.4 kg (9.7 lb) with Weight Watchers down to 1.4 kg on a program led by primary care staff.

A control group who were not put on any specific diet program but were given vouchers for free access to a gym for 12 weeks lost just as much weight on average as those using health clinic-based based weight-loss programs.

After a year, statistically significant weight loss was recorded in all groups apart from the primary care programs, but Weight Watchers was the only program to achieve significantly greater weight loss than the control group.

Kate Jolly, a clinical senior lecturer in public health and epidemiology at Birmingham who led the research, said primary care-based weight loss services led by specially trained staff are ""ineffective"" while commercially provided services ""are more effective and cheaper.""

Worldwide, around 1.5 billion adults are overweight and another 0.5 billion are obese, with 170 million children classified as overweight or obese.

Obesity takes up between 2 to 6 percent of healthcare costs in many countries.

This latest research, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), comes in the wake of the first gold-standard randomized controlled trial of Weight Watchers last month which showed that the program works far better than getting doctors to tell patients to lose weight.

Another study in the United States published in 2003 found that one year's free access to Weight Watchers resulted in an average weight reduction of 3.5 kg after one year.

In the BMJ study, which involved 740 obese and overweight men and women in Britain, several other commercial weight loss programs were also studied including Slimming World, Rosemary Conley and a group-based dietetics program as well as general practice one to one counseling and pharmacy-led one to one counseling.

Weight Watchers and Slimming World are both group-based weight-loss schemes where people trying to shed pounds are given dieting tips and encouraged to go to weekly meetings to be weighed and discuss their progress with other members.

At a cost of roughly 40 pounds ($64) for 12 weeks, they are also relatively inexpensive, particularly when compared to the billions of dollars spent on healthcare for overweight and obese people worldwide every year.

In a commentary on the BMJ study, nutrition experts Helen Truby and Maxine Bonham from Monash University in Australia said it showed there is ""no simple solution"" to the obesity epidemic.

They said the UK's state-funded National Health Service (NHS) should be aware of the level of investment needed to develop an expert workforce to manage the problem of obesity, and said it could learn a great deal from commercial companies about how to deliver what consumers want.","{""British Medical Journal"": 1, ""BMJ"": 1}","{""Kate Jolly"": 1, ""Rosemary Conley"": 1, ""Helen Truby"": 1, ""Maxine Bonham"": 1}","{""Weight Watchers"": 5, ""Slimming World"": 3, ""Birmingham University"": 1, ""the British Medical Journal"": 1, ""BMJ"": 3, ""Monash University"": 1, ""National Health Service"": 1, ""NHS"": 1}","{""Kate Jolly"": 1, ""Helen Truby"": 1, ""Maxine Bonham"": 1}","{""Birmingham University"": 1, ""Weight Watchers"": 3, ""the British Medical Journal"": 1, ""BMJ"": 2, ""Monash University"": 1, ""National Health Service"": 1, ""NHS"": 1}"
01-11-023_metro,2011-11-04,Join a club if you want to get thin,"IF YOU want to lose weight, the best way is to join a commercial diet programme.

Dieters who sign up to schemes run by Weight Watchers, Slimming World, Rosemary Conley and the like lose more weight, more effectively than similar plans offered by GPs.

People on 'private' programmes lost an average of 2.3kg (5lb) more than those in NHS schemes, a study by the University of Birmingham found.

It focused on 740 obese or overweight people in the city who were divided into six groups.

All the schemes achieved weight loss at 12 weeks - from an average of 1.37kg (3lb) in the GP group to 4.43kg (10lb) in the Weight Watchers group.

At the one-year mark, all the programmes, except the GP group and one other, had resulted in 'signifi-cant weight loss'.

The GP group was found to be no better than the control group - where people exercised at a local fitness centre.

It appears that gentle peer pressure and mutual support motivates people more strongly than a doctor's advice.

People were also least likely to attend GP practice sessions.

The study concluded: 'Commercially provided weight management services are more effective and cheaper than primary care-based services led by specially trained staff, which are ineffective.'

A Department of Health spokesman said: 'Weight management programmes can be very cost-effective and make losing weight easier for some people, but the best way to lose weight will be different for everyone.'

Dr Jacquie Lavin, from Slimming World, said: 'If responsibility for public health and obesity in communities moves across to public health teams in local authorities, as the Government plans, commissioners need to be working closely with us.'",,"{""Rosemary Conley"": 1, ""Jacquie Lavin"": 1}","{""Weight Watchers"": 2, ""Slimming World"": 2, ""NHS"": 1, ""the University of Birmingham"": 1, ""GP"": 4, ""Department of Health"": 1, ""Government"": 1}","{""Jacquie Lavin"": 1}","{""Weight Watchers"": 2, ""Slimming World"": 2, ""GP"": 2, ""NHS"": 1, ""the University of Birmingham"": 1, ""Department of Health"": 1, ""Government"": 1}"
08-11-028_guardian,2011-11-17,Study reveals one in 12 adolescents engage in self-harm: At-risk group often abuses alcohol and narcotics Incidence rate on rise for women aged 15 to 24,"One in 12 adolescents self-harm but most will stop in early adulthood, according to a study of the scale of the problem and the reasons why young people want to hurt themselves.

The extent of the problem - which is worse among girls, of whom one in 10 self-harm - is exposed in the study published in the Lancet, which followed nearly 2,000 young people from the age of 14 to 29. 

It points to the emotional vulnerability of teenagers, prey not only to a maelstrom of hormonal changes but also complex developments of their brain. 

Many of the same young people who self-harm in secret are also drinking to excess, taking drugs and suffering depression and anxiety.

The study was carried out among young people in the state of Victoria in Australia, but the authors say the picture is no different in the UK.

These teenagers, said Professor George Patton, from the centre for adolescent health at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Melbourne, who is one of the authors, ""could be said to be on a fast track to adulthood. 

They are the kids who are at the margins of their family, on the margins at school, who are engaging with early sexual activity, who are using drugs and alcohol from an early age. 

This group of kids is at the highest risk of self-harm.""

Such young people were identifiable and could be helped. 

""We are talking about a window of vulnerability which lasts through the mid-teens, where we believe a social scaffolding for young people is very important,"" he said.

 ""By that I mean young people are going to be most protected from self-harm by good connections and good involvement with their families and good engagement and commitment with their school and good engagement with their peer group.""

During puberty, said Patton, important changes to the brain take place, but the frontal cortex matures later than the limbic system, causing an imbalance. 

Added to that is what Dr Paul Moran, of the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, another of the authors, described as the ""chemical melting pot"" of hormonal changes.

Under those circumstances, a teenager exposed to stress and emotional difficulty could respond by self-harming. 

Moran talked of the importance of family factors.

A lot was made of childhood maltreatment and abuse, but also important was ""how affection is shared out in families - how striving behaviour is encouraged"", he said. 

Teenagers may feel pressure on them to succeed. 

""Affection can be conditional on success. 

That can be very toxic in a family.""

Self-harm is one of the strongest predictors of suicide, the authors say. 

It is especially common, and seems to be on the rise, among young women between the ages of 15 and 24. 

The study recruited nearly 2,000 schoolchildren in 1992 and tracked them through to 2008, collecting data nine times in total on a whole range of behaviours. 

Self-cutting and burning were the most common forms of self-harm in adolescence; some of the other methods included poisoning, overdosing and self-battery. 

Self-harm in adolescence was associated with depression and anxiety, antisocial behaviour, high-risk alcohol use (which doubled the risk), cannabis use and cigarette smoking.

Sue Minto, head of the NSPCC's ChildLine, which last year dealt with 30,000 contacts from children about self-harm, suicide and depression, said it was vital to find out why a child self-harms. 

""Something is obviously making them extremely unhappy or frightened and until this is resolved, it is likely they will continue to injure themselves or, in extreme cases, be driven to suicide,"" she said.

""Many of the children who contact ChildLine start to self-harm because they are being abused in some way. 

They need help to resolve these problems and they also need to be reassured that whatever is causing them deep anxiety is not their fault.""

Lucie Russell, director of campaigns at Young Minds, said self-harming was getting more common. 

""What's made it worse are the online communities around this. 

It is the same as with the pro-anorexia sites. 

It is about supporting each other, but it isn't always about supporting each other - it is about 'this is OK to do'."" One of the reasons it appeared to be on the rise, she said, could be ""that it is so pressurising, growing up in this society, with all the social networking and bullying as well"".

But the problem resolves itself spontaneously by the late teens in about 90 per cent of cases despite the fact many victims receive no treatment for their problem, according to the first study ever to follow teenage self-harmers into adulthood. 

The research showed that while girls were more likely to deliberately hurt themselves, boys who did so put themselves at more serious risk, for example by running in front of cars or playing ""chicken"" with trains. 

Self-harming is seen as one of the key indicators of suicide risk, with 60 per cent of suicide victims having a history of self harm, the researchers added. 

According to previous studies, teenagers who report to hospital for self-harm 100 times more likely to end their own life than the average population. 

British and Australian researchers questioned 1,800 Australian 14-year-olds about self-harming at nine stages, ending in their late twenties. 

The researchers found that most teenage self-harmers began cutting, burning or otherwise causing themselves serious hurt at the age of 14 or 15, and that by their 20s nine in ten had stopped doing so. 

Dr Paul Moran, of King's College London, said: ""The study did not measure whether the participants had interventions, but there is no firm evidence that any treatment to prevent self-harm works."" 

Writing in The Lancet, the authors concluded: ""Our findings suggest that most adolescent self-harming behaviour resolves spontaneously."" 

Prof George Patton, of the University of Melbourne, Australia, said the problem could be caused by changes in the adolescent brain during the transition from childhood to full adulthood. 

He said: ""There are profound biological changes that happen at the time of puberty and many of these are hormonal. 

""It is likely that these changes underpin the rise in difficulties in emotion that many adolescents report, in particular adolescent girls. 

But then there is a great gap before the structures that are involved in emotional regulation fully mature. 

""The prefrontal cortex, which is crucially involved in emotional regulation, in planning, in problem solving - that is now developing apace and will continue to develop until at least the mid-20s.

For most people the problem will resolve before adulthood but for 10% it will continue into their adult lives.



Teenage girls are more likely to self-harm than boys and are at greater risk of continuing as young adults.



The Lancet study findings have important implications for the treatment of mental health issues and prevention of suicide in young adults.



The study looked at almost 2,000 adolescents in Australia, repeatedly surveying them over a period of 15 years.



Researchers found that anxiety, depression, heavy alcohol use, cigarette smoking and cannabis use were all associated with self-harm. 



The study suggests that self-cutting and burning were the commonest forms of self-harm during adolescence. 



As 90% of teenagers who self-harmed stopped before they reached adulthood, the research should offer some reassurance to families, schools and clinicians, the authors of the study say. 



But, Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity SANE, said:



""The figures showing that 90% have stopped by the time they reach their twenties should not seduce us into thinking that self harm is just a phase that young people will grow out of"".



Suicide risk?

 

""Our research shows that counter to common perception, people self-harm and continue to self-harm at times throughout their lives to protect themselves from attempting suicide and their families and friends from experiencing their mental pain.""



Because of the association between self-harm and suicide, the researchers suggest treating common teenage mental health problems could be part of an ""important and hitherto unrecognised component"" of preventing suicide in adults.



""Self-harm is one of the most significant predictors of completed suicide, "" a lead author, Dr Paul Moran, of King's College London, said. 



Of the people who have died by suicide, around 50-60% have a known history of self-harm, according to Professor Keith Hawton, Director of the Centre for Suicide Research, University of Oxford. 



How many people who have self-harmed die due to suicide, is less clear.



'Hidden population'

 

But Professor Keith Hawton, who was not involved in the study, said the findings could broaden the focus of the Suicide Prevention Strategy for England, which he is working on. 



""We now know from studies like this one..... that there is a very large population of youngsters who are self-harming in the community. 

And we estimate about one in eight of them go to hospital. So this is the hidden population,"" he said.



""Though a focus on hospital management is crucial, what we should perhaps be thinking more of is the management of self-harm at a community level, particularly how schools respond and how families can be helped to respond,"" he said.



The authors say it is important that people living or working with young people are able to spot signs of distress and find the help they deserve. 



""Otherwise there may be persistent ramifications in later life,"" Dr Paul Moran said. 



Sue Minto, Head of ChildLine, which last year dealt with 30,000 contacts from children about self-harm, suicide and depression, said:

Since self-harming is one of the strongest predictors of who will go on to commit suicide, the psychiatrists who conducted the study said they hoped its findings would help galvanise support for more active and earlier intervention for people at risk.

""The numbers we're talking about here are huge,"" said Keith Hawton of the Centre for Suicide Research at Britain's Oxford University, who reviewed the findings at a briefing in London.

George Patton, who led the study at the Centre for Adolescent Health at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia, said the findings revealed a ""window of vulnerability"" when young people were in their mid-teens and often struggling with emotional control.

""Self-harming represents a way of dealing with those emotions,"" he told the briefing.

In a report of their work in the Lancet medical journal, Patton's team also said young people who self-harm often have mental health problems that might not resolve without treatment.

""Because of the association between self-harm and suicide...the treatment of common mental disorders during adolescence could constitute an important...component of suicide prevention in young adults,"" they said.

Self-harm is a global health problem and is especially common among girls and women aged 15 to 24. 

Experts say they fear rates of self-abuse in this age group may be rising.

According to the World Health Organisation, almost a million people die from suicide each year, giving a mortality rate of 16 per 100,000, or one death every 40 seconds. 

In the last 45 years, suicide rates have increased by 60 percent worldwide.

""MELTING POT""

In this study, Patton and Paul Moran of King's College London's Institute of Psychiatry followed a sample of young people in Victoria, Australia aged from around 15 to around 29 between 1992 and 2008.

A total of 1,802 people responded in the adolescent phase, and 149, or 8 percent, of them reported self-harm.

More girls than boys said they self-harmed -- with rates of 10 percent and 6 percent respectively, translating to a 60 percent increased risk of self-harm in girls compared with boys.

Moran said a combination of hormonal changes during puberty, brain changes in the mid-teens with the final development of the pre-frontal cortex -- the brain area associated with planning, personality expression and moderating behaviour -- and environmental factors such as peer pressure, emotional difficulties and family tensions appeared to be key factors.

""Hormonal changes are highly likely to be important in creating a sort of chemical melting pot which is very ripe for environmental factors to start working on -- particularly difficult family dynamics,"" he said.

Cutting and burning was the most common form of self-harm for adolescents, with other methods such as poisoning, taking overdoses, and battery also featuring.

By the time the participants reached young adulthood, however, rates of self-harm dropped dramatically so that by age 29, less than 1 percent of participants reported deliberately doing something they knew would hurt or endanger themselves.

The researchers said while it was reassuring that around 90 percent of teenagers who report self-harm are no longer doing it in adulthood, it was also important to recognise the high risks for the 10 percent who continue to do so as they grow up.

Hawton said previous studies had shown that self-harmers who come into hospital during their teenage and young adult years are 100 times more likely than the general population to commit suicide.

08-11-003_bbcnews,2011-02-03,Genes 'play key role in classroom performance',"Identical twins were found to achieve more similar results in tests at age 12 

Politicians may be keen to measure schools' effectiveness, but the quality of the school environment is only half of the story, researchers have found.

Academics at King's College London's Institute of Psychiatry say the genetic factors children bring to the classroom are just as influential.

In a study of 4,000 sets of UK twins, nature and nurture was found to have an equal effect on their achievements.

Researchers say this strengthens the case for personalised learning.

The researchers examined the test results of 12-year-old twins - identical and fraternal - in English, maths and science.

They found the identical twins, who share their genetic make-up, did more similarly in the tests than the fraternal twins, who share half their genetic make-up.

The report said: ""The results were striking, indicating that even when previous achievement and a child's general cognitive ability are both removed, the residual achievement measure is still significantly influenced by genetic factors.""

'Drawing out' potential 

The study says the findings point to a need to re-examine what schools, colleges and universities offer young people, particularly in the light of modern technology.

 “This genetic perspective on learning suggests a return to the original meaning of education (from the Latin educatio, which means 'to draw out')” Institute of Psychiatry report 

It says: ""Instead of thinking about education as a way of countering genetic differences among children, the field of education might profit from accepting that children differ genetically in how much they learn.

""This way of thinking is compatible with the current trend towards personalising education by optimising children's learning, which is increasingly possible through the use of interactive information technology.""

The report concludes: ""More generally, instead of thinking about education as instruction (from the Latin instruo, which means 'to build in'), this genetic perspective on learning suggests a return to the original meaning of education (from the Latin educatio, which means 'to draw out').

""That is, instead of a model of instruction in which children are the passive recipients of knowledge, a genetically sensitive approach to education suggests an active view of learning in which children select, modify and create their own education in part on the basis of their genetic propensities.""

'Active participants' 

The lead researcher, geneticist Dr Claire Haworth, said taking a genetic perspective on education meant moving away from the notion of children being ""passive recipients"" of knowledge.

Instead, children should be seen as active participants who ""select, modify and create"" their own education - in part on the basis of their genetic propensities.

""These findings do not mean that educational quality is unimportant, in fact environmental factors were just as important as genetic factors,"" said Dr Haworth. 

""However, these results do suggest that children bring characteristics to the classroom that influence how well they will take advantage of the quality.

04-11-009_dailymail,2011-09-15,Student juggles medical degree with professional ice hockey AND makes breast cancer breakthrough,"A professional ice hockey player who is also studying to become a doctor has made a major breakthrough in the fight against breast cancer.

Luke Piggott, 25, splits his time between the laboratory and the ice rink where he is a Great Britain international.

Now his research in the lab has uncovered a way of killing breast cancer stem cells.

Experts say his breakthrough, published in the journal Breast Cancer research, has hit the disease's Achilles' heel.

Luke, a PhD student at Cardiff University, was using an anti-cancer agent called TRAIL which has not previously been tried in the treatment of breast cancer.

The 180lb goal scorer was peering through a microscope the morning after a match when he noticed something remarkable was happening.

He said: 'I didn't really expect to see what I did. I was expecting to see the stem cells move along the microscope.

'But then I looked again and they'd all died.

'I did it again to check, and then you check again and again and you start to believe it.'

Luke discovered the drug knocked out a protein called c-FLIP which gave stem cells their drug resistance.

Using this method he has achieved a 98 per cent reduction in secondary tumours in the laboratory.

But Luke has no plans of swapping his hockey jersey for a full-time laboratory white coat.

He will continue to play professionally for the Cardiff Devils on a two-way contract which allows him to continue his research and play the game he loves.

Luke was the team's top scorer last season and plays in the English National League.

He said: 'I am very lucky in that my supervisor is very flexible with me combining my sporting career with my research.

'He has always been up front with me and so long as my quality of academic work remains high, it's not a problem.

'I even use the long trips to away games as an opportunity to read and study.

'So far, neither of my careers seems to have hindered the other.'

His research supervisor, Dr Richard Clarkson, said: 'We've identified the Achilles' heel of cancer stem cells.

'Cancer stem cells make up about one per cent of the tumour itself and they seed tumour growth elsewhere in the body.

'If we target the rest of the tumour but don't hit this one per cent which is usually drug resistant you can get relapse and spread.

'Tumours in the breast don't kill but as soon as it spreads it becomes a life-threatening situation.

'It's only a matter of time before we find ways of hitting that target therapeutically with drugs in patients.'

Luke is in his second year of his PhD which is funded by the Cardiff-based cancer charity Tenovus.

Dr Lisa Wilde, director of research at Breast Cancer Campaign, said: 'More than 12,000 people die each year from breast cancer in the UK, mainly as a result of the disease spreading to other parts of the body.

'Luke's research is an important early step in understanding the role cancer stem cells play in this process.

'It could help us develop desperately needed new treatments to halt breast cancer spread in its tracks.'","{""Breast Cancer research"": 1}","{""Luke Piggott"": 1, ""Achilles"": 2, ""Luke"": 5, ""Richard Clarkson"": 1, ""Lisa Wilde"": 1}","{""Breast Cancer"": 1, ""Cardiff University"": 1, ""the Cardiff Devils"": 1, ""the English National League"": 1, ""Tenovus"": 1, ""Breast Cancer Campaign"": 1, ""'Luke"": 1}","{""Achilles"": 1, ""Richard Clarkson"": 1}","{""Breast Cancer"": 2, ""Cardiff University"": 1, ""Tenovus"": 1, ""Breast Cancer Campaign"": 1}"
04-11-009_express,2011-09-16,Ice hockey star takes a big stick to cancer,"Luke, 25, finds way to stop spread of breast tumours

A UNIVERSITY student who doubles as a professional ice hockey player has made a major medical breakthrough in the fight against breast cancer.

Research carried out by Luke Piggott, 25, has revealed a way to kill the highly resistant cells that are responsible for making the tumours spread.

Experts say his ""significent"" discovery could lead to new treatments in combating the disease that kills more than 12,000 people in Britain each year.

Luke, who is studying for a PhD at Cardiff University, also dazzles fans of local ice hockey club Cardiff Devils and last season was the team's top scorer with 38 goals in 38 games.

He said he was ""shocked"" when he realised he had made a major medical discovery.

""I repeated the experiment and then repeated it again and when I realised the same thing was happening, I rushed into my supervisor's office, "" he said.

His research had been concentrating on the stem cells in cancer tumours, which scientists believe are responsible for cancer growth, spread and relapse.

They are highly resistant to drugs, thought to be due to their ability to produce a protein called c-FLIP which makes them immune to an anti-cancer agent labelled TRAIL, which is being used in clinical trials On his own initiative, Luke experimented with a chemical that stopped the stem cells producing c-FLIP, thus over coming their resistance to TRAIL.

His research, published in the journal Breast Cancer Research, marks the first time a scientist has found a way to kill the stem cells in breast cancer tumours and leave normal cells unharmed.

Lecturer Dr Richard Clarkson, who is supervising Luke's research, said: ""Luke did an experiment on the stem cells that I had not asked him to do.

He then came to me with the findings and we took it from there.

""This is a major breakthrough and certainly a significant step forward in potentially finding new treatments for breast cancer.

""It is early days though and important to point out that we don't know whether a tumour in a patient with breast cancer will respond in the same way.

""The agent used to make the cells lose their resistance to TRAIL has never been used in people, so we don't know yet whether that is a viable option.

""But this is the first time we have demonstrated a complete kill of the cells which we know kill people.""

Luke, who has just signed a new contract with Cardiff Devils, said: ""I love ice hockey and I love my work, so hopefully I will continue to do both.

""Richard is very supportive and allows me to fit in my training.

At the moment, finishing my PhD is my priority.""

19-11-012_independent,2011-10-04,Thin parents pass on 'skinny genes' to children,"Children whose parents are thin are likely to be very slim themselves due to ""skinny genes"", new research suggests.

Youngsters whose parents are at the lower end of the healthy weight range are three times more likely to be regarded as thin (weighing less than a healthy weight range) than those whose parents are overweight.

The study recorded the height and weight of parents and up to two children from 7,000 families over a five-year period.

Analysis of body mass index (BMI) found that when both parents were at the lower half of the ideal BMI range, the chance of the child being thin was 16.2%, compared with 7.8% when both parents were in the upper half.

These children had a BMI of 18.5 or under (regarded as ""thin""), compared with a healthy weight range of 18.5 to 24.9. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is overweight and over 30 is obese.

The study found that the chance of a child being thin (BMI under 18.5) was just 5.3% when both parents were overweight and only 2.5% for children whose parents were obese.

Today's study, published in the journal Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, suggests thinness may be inherited, with children of thinner parents being likely to be genetically predisposed to a lower body weight.

Lead author Dr Katriina Whitaker, from University College London's department of epidemiology and public health, said: ""We know from other studies that children's weights are correlated with those of their parents, but previous research has tended to focus on obesity rather than the other end of the spectrum.""

Professor Jane Wardle, from the same unit, added: ""Parents are often concerned if their child is thin, but it may just be their 'skinny genes'.

""All genes have two versions, called alleles.

""We might think of weight-related genes as having a 'skinny' and 'curvy' allele.

04-11-017_dailymail,2011-11-09,"Parkinson's disease symptoms 'can be improved by teaching patients to regulate their brains'

Patients able to increase finger speed by monitoring MRI scans

Learned to alter parts of brain affected by degenerative disease

But technique will not stop progression of condition","Patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease may be able to improve their symptoms by learning to regulate their brains, a study suggests.

A group of five patients were able to increase their motor speed by monitoring magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of their own brain activity as they carried out a finger-tapping task.

After a time, they had learned to alter activity in specific parts of the brain affected by Parkinson's.

Similar biofeedback techniques have previously been used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and combat chronic pain.

 Study leader Professor David Linden, from the University of Cardiff, said: 'This is the first time that this neurofeedback technique has been used with patients with Parkinson's disease.

'Self-regulation of brain activity in humans based on real-time feedback is emerging as a powerful technique. 

In this study, we assessed whether patients with Parkinson's disease are able to alter their brain activity to improve their motor function.

'We found that the five patients who received neurofeedback were able to increase activity in brain networks important for movements and that this intervention resulted in an overall improvement in motor speed - in this case, finger tapping.'

The findings were reported today in The Journal of Neuroscience.

In total, 10 patients took part in the study, all with early-stage Parkinson's.

Half were assigned to brain feedback and half were not. 

When their performance was compared, the feedback group did best.

The scientists now hope to test the technique further in larger clinical trials.

Prof Linden added: 'While this was a very small study, the key aim was to establish whether this technique may be feasible for sufferers.

'The training resulted in clinically relevant improvement of motor functions - so assuming patients can learn to transfer the strategies used during neurofeedback into real-life settings, it might also become possible to sustain the clinical benefits.

'We have to be clear: this research won't stop the progression of the disease nor should it offer sufferers false hope. 

But it does have the potential to alter the course of motor symptoms and possibly reduce drug requirements in early disease.

'This may have the effect of delaying more severe motor complications and improve the quality of life of patients affected by Parkinson's disease.'","{""The Journal of Neuroscience"": 1}","{""David Linden"": 1, ""Prof Linden"": 1}","{""the University of Cardiff"": 1, ""The Journal of Neuroscience"": 1}","{""David Linden"": 1}","{""the University of Cardiff"": 1}"

Patients with the early stages of the disease were trained to control areas of the brain associated with movement by using the power of thought alone.

A clinical evaluation later found their movement had improved by up to a third.

The charity Parkinson's UK described the research as ""exciting"" but stressed ""these are very early days"".

The study, published in The Journal of Neuroscience, involved ten patients with the disease that affects the brain and results in slow movements and a tremor.

Five patients received the brain regulation feedback technique and five acted as a control.

Activity mapping 

Patients undergoing the training were placed in a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner in Bangor, Gwynedd. 

At first, they were asked to squeeze a hand as the team mapped the regions of the brain responsible for controlling movement.

Then, in real time, the subjects were shown the level of activity in these regions displayed on a gauge above them. 

They were asked to imagine making complex movements in order to activate the brain centres, and saw a corresponding increase on the gauge. 

With practice, they were able to increase and decrease the level of activity at will, through thought alone.

Prof David Linden from Cardiff University, who led the research, described the process as ""real-time neural feedback"".

Motor function 

""Self-regulation of brain activity in humans based on real-time feedback is emerging as a powerful technique,"" said Prof Linden.

""In this study we assessed whether patients with Parkinson's disease are able to alter their brain activity to improve their motor function. 

We wanted them to activate the brain regions associated with movement through the force of their mind,"" he explained.

The professor stressed that the technique did not offer a cure but he said that improved function could lead to a better quality of life.

""We found that the five patients who received neuro feedback were able to increase activity in brain networks important for movements and that this intervention resulted in an overall improvement in motor speed - in this case, finger tapping,"" said Prof Linden.

""The training resulted in clinically relevant improvement of motor functions - so assuming patients can learn to transfer the strategies used during neuro feedback into real-life settings, it might also become possible to sustain the clinical benefits,"" he added.

The research team said the study was a small scale proof of principle and they now hope to stage a larger, randomised, clinical trial.

'Amazing' brain 

Claire Bale, senior research communications officer at Parkinson's UK, said: ""This study showed that people with Parkinson's were able to alter their own brain activity to improve their movement symptoms using neurofeedback from brain scans. This highlights the amazing ability of the brain to change and adapt"". 

""While these results are exciting, these are very early days. 

We need much larger, in-depth studies to help us understand the potential these techniques may have to tackle some of the symptoms of Parkinson's,"" said Ms Bale.

The research into Parkinson's disease was the result of a collaboration between Cardiff University and scientists and doctors from north Wales, London and the Netherlands.

Prof Linden has also carried out a pilot trial using the neuro feedback technique on patients suffering with depression.

07-11-026_dailymail,2011-09-26,BABIES WHO ARE ALREADY OBESE INSIDE THE WOMB,"CHILDHOOD obesity starts in the womb, with overweight mothers giving birth to fat babies.

New scanning techniques have allowed British scientists to examine fat levels in newborn babies.

They found some had built up fat around their abdomen in the same way as adults in their 50s.

It is the first direct link to be shown between the weight of a mother-to-be and her child.

Obese youngsters are more likely to develop a string of health problems, including heart disease, brittle bones, diabetes and asthma.

Almost half of women of child-bearing age are overweight or obese and more than 15 per cent of pregnant women are obese.

This also raises their odds of dying in pregnancy, of their baby being stillborn and a host of pregnancy complications, some of which can be fatal.

The study was led by Professor Neena Modi, the UK's top authority on high-risk health problems in newborns.

She said magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans had provided clear evidence that being overweight or obese in pregnancy could result in potentially harmful changes to a baby's fat levels while still in the womb. 

Her team, which studied 54 boys and 51 girls at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, found a total of 31 babies had more adipose, or fat, tissue around their abdomen than would have been expected.

This increased proportionately with the obesity of the mother.

Professor Modi, professor of neonatal medicine at Imperial College London, said: 'The biological changes identified in the study were increased total fat, particularly around the tummy.

'I was very surprised to be able to detect such a clear continuum of effect of maternal BMI (body mass index) on the baby.

'This is a very important finding indeed, opening the door to a new understanding of how a mother's metabolism affects her baby.

'This shows how sensitive the baby is to the environment experienced within the womb and how lifelong effects may be initiated before birth.'

In adults, adipose tissue is found mainly under the skin, but also in deposits between the muscles, around the intestines and around the heart Ð collecting fats which come from food eaten or produced in the body.

Newborn babies typically have about 700g of adipose tissue, but for each unit increase in maternal BMI, this increased by approximately 7g with a huge build-up in fat in the babies' livers.

'Normally, a newborn baby has minimal or no detectable liver fat,' said Professor Modi.

'But for each unit increase in maternal BMI, the baby's liver fat content increased by 8 per cent.'

The findings come as experts predict obesity will cost the NHS up to £6.3billion a year by 2015 unless more is done to tackle the spiralling problem.

Professor Modi said it was important that all women hoping to have families were aware that being obese could affect their unborn children's health prospects.

'Adipose tissue not only stores energy and provides insulation, but is also a source of variety of hormones. 

Being too fat is unhealthy and increases the risk of many diseases.

'In adults too much adipose tissue around the tummy is particularly bad and is associated with much greater risk of developing heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes.'

The study of babies at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, west London, used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to investigate links between obesity in children and their mothers.

""This shows how sensitive the baby is to the environment experienced within the womb and how lifelong effects may be initiated before birth,"" she said. 

Body mass index is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in metres. 

The World Health Organisation classes a BMI between 18.5 and 25 as normal weight, between 25 and 30 as overweight and over 30 as obese. 

In adults, high amounts of fat around the stomach and in the liver impair their control of blood sugar, leading to diabetes.

20-11-005_mirror,2011-05-17,STRESSED-OUT BABIES CAN BECOME PROBLEM KIDS,"Babies who cry a lot could turn into problem children, even developing certain behavioural conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

It seems that persistent crying in children can lead to a whole spectrum of disorders in childhood including ADHD, anxiety, depression, withdrawal, aggression, destructive behaviour and temper tantrums.

In the study, besides persistent crying, babies had feeding and sleeping difficulties. 

It seems the harder a baby finds settling itself, the more likely the baby will grow up to become a child with behavioural problems.

The report was produced by the universities of Warwick in the UK, Basel in Switzerland and Bochum in Germany.

Researchers analysed 22 studies carried out between 1987 and 2006, involving nearly 1,700 children.

What interests me is why babies cry persistently at all. 

Research that shows early brain development can make all the difference to a baby's happiness in later life may be the answer.

The kind of emotional experiences a baby has, starting in the womb, are embedded in her system for life.

Leaving a newborn to cry is particularly dangerous because, if ignored, it results in high levels of stress hormones, which dampen the formation of a healthy brain that can deal with powerful emotions.

A baby is born expecting to have stress managed for her by parents.

Stress hormone levels will remain low if a parent keeps the child content by holding, stroking, nuzzling, whispering, laughing and feeding it.

However, as a baby's emotions are unstable, those hormones can shoot up if there is no caring adult to take care of the child's emotional needs, or one that's able to quieten the baby as required.

It's this research that makes me a firm believer in never letting a baby cry.

The new report does not reveal if persistently crying babies were comforted and taught to deal with stressful moments by learning to comfort themselves.

But caring for a crying baby results in an outpouring of love hormones that counteract the stress in the baby's brain - and the baby will remember this calming sensation.

After much comforting, the baby will be able to remember that feeling and produce the love hormones for herself.

Babies who can do this do not tend to grow up with behaviour disorders.

They turn out to be affectionate, friendly, able to share, outgoing, social, smiley children - and they often do well at school.

So why would anyone let a baby cry?",,{},{},,
20-11-005_bbcnews,2011-04-21,Cry-baby 'link to behavioural problems',"Excessive crying as a baby may hint at behavioural problems later in life.

Babies who cry excessively and have problems feeding and sleeping have a greater risk of serious behavioural problems later in life, say scientists.

One in five babies has symptoms that could lead to conditions such as ADHD, according to research published in Archives of Disease in Childhood.

The review of previous studies looked at nearly 17,000 children.

A child-health expert said it would be wrong for parents to be ""overly alarmed"" by the results.

Crying in babies is normal, but some cry ""excessively"" after the age of three months for reasons other than colic.

An international group of researchers looked at this as well as problems eating and sleeping.

By comparing data from 22 studies from 1987 to 2006, they found a link between these issues and problems later in life.

Behaviour problems :

There was an increased risk of ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), anxiety and depression as well as aggressive behaviour.

The research showed that a baby with more than one risk factor was even more likely to develop behavioural problems.

Professor Dieter Wolke, from the University of Warwick, told the BBC: ""It is about a 100% increase in risk, a doubling of risk of behavioural problems with excessive crying, sleeping and eating problems.""

Jane Valente, a consultant paediatrician at Great Ormond Street Hospital, said: ""It would be wrong for people to get overly alarmed. 

I don't think on the basis of this report people should be going to their GPs.

""If a baby is not behaving like other babies it is probably worth discussing with a midwife or health visitor.""

The study cannot tell if issues as a baby cause behavioural problems later in life: they could be an early symptom of those later problems. 

Professor Wolke said while there were treatments for problem crying, feeding and sleeping in babies, there was no research assessing their impact later in life.

He added: ""If you could prevent behavioural problems with an early intervention, in a public health-sense it could be very important.""

Professor Mitch Blair, officer for health promotion at The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ""It is an important study.""

He said parents were very good at knowing when something was wrong with their children and that the study ""really reinforces the need for attention at an early stage to prevent issues later in childhood"".","{""Archives of Disease in Childhood"": 1, ""Paediatrics"": 1}","{""Dieter Wolke"": 1, ""Jane Valente"": 1, ""Wolke"": 1, ""Mitch Blair"": 1}","{""Archives of Disease in Childhood"": 1, ""the University of Warwick"": 1, ""BBC"": 1, ""Great Ormond Street Hospital"": 1, ""The Royal College of Paediatrics"": 1, ""Child Health"": 1}","{""Dieter Wolke"": 1, ""Wolke"": 1}","{""the University of Warwick"": 1, ""BBC"": 1, ""Great Ormond Street Hospital"": 1, ""The Royal College of Paediatrics"": 1, ""Child Health"": 1}"

03-11-038_telegraph,2011-10-12,Genetic liver conditon corrected with stem cells; A genetic fault responsible for a fatal liver condition has been completely corrected by Cambridge scientists in a stem cell experiment which could bring patient-specific treatments closer to reality.,"Using stem cells engineered from human skin, scientists were able to correct a genetic mutation which leads to liver and lung disease, turn the cells into healthy liver cells and use them to replace damaged tissue.

The research, conducted in test tubes and on mice, has yet to be tested on humans but could lead to a new range of specialised cell treatments.

Scientists believe that the ability to mend defective genes in stem cells, which create every type of tissue in the body, would enable them to tackle mutations that cause a wide range of diseases.

Researchers from Cambridge and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute targeted a gene which protects against inflammation in the liver by producing a certain protein. 

In patients with a mutation in the gene - a disorder which affects about one in 2,000 northern European people - the protein becomes trapped in the liver, and leads to cirrhosis of the liver and lung emphysema. 

Using ""molecular scissors"" the scientists were able to cut away the mutated section of DNA from a stem cell and replace it with a corrected version, according to a report in the Nature journal. 

The stem cells went on to generate liver cells which contained normal protein levels, indicating that the previously faulty gene was now working normally.

Prof Allan Bradley, director emeritus of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said: ""Our systems leave behind no trace of the genetic manipulation, save for the gene correction.

Revolutionary new treatments and cures, we were told, were just around the corner.

But when the 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger died during a clinical trial for a revolutionary new gene therapy technique in 1999, that bubble of expectation burst.

The mantle of medical hyperbole - and the funding - moved on to other, as yet untarnished advances, including stem cells and the promise of personalised medicine.

Although investment in gene therapy withered, away from the limelight research has continued and in the intervening years a number of important breakthroughs and treatments have been developed.

The latest of these, described in a paper published in the journal Nature, may go some way towards reinstating gene therapy in medical science's premier league.

Scientists at the Wellcome Trust's Sanger Institute and the University of Cambridge have succeeded in correcting the genetic mutation responsible for Antitrypsin deficiency - a debilitating condition that causes cirrhotic liver disease and lung emphysema in some 30,000 patients in the UK alone.

Starting with a skin biopsy from a patient suffering from the disease the team derived a population of iPS, or induced pluripotent stem cells, containing faulty copies of the alpha-1 antitrypsin gene. 

Using molecular scissors they then removed the abnormal copies of the gene and replaced them with corrected versions, before stimulating the stem cells to differentiate into liver cells. 

Finally they implanted these healthy liver cells into a mouse model - demonstrating not only that they functioned properly, but that over time, they re-populated the entire organ generating a disease-free liver.

Speaking on the programme this morning Cambridge University's Professor David Lomas hailed the result as a remarkable breakthrough.

""The genetic correction is really quite a phenomenal technical advance.

Now we have to understand how we can safely use these cells in patients, because it's most important we don't do harm.

The cells that we put back in have to be effective, have to function well, but most of all have to cause no harm to the patient.""

It's early days, but if researchers can overcome the technical obstacles and safety concerns, the technique could offer patients a viable alternative to a liver transplant and a lifetime on immuno-suppressant drugs - and help bring gene therapy in from the cold.","{""Nature"": 1}","{""Jesse Gelsinger"": 1, ""David Lomas"": 1}","{""the Wellcome Trust's"": 1, ""Sanger Institute"": 1, ""the University of Cambridge"": 1, ""Cambridge University's"": 1}","{""Jesse Gelsinger"": 1, ""David Lomas"": 1}","{""the Wellcome Trust's"": 1, ""Sanger Institute"": 1, ""the University of Cambridge"": 1, ""Cambridge University's"": 1}"

Researchers at Edinburgh University have shown how two receptors in older brains react to the stress hormone cortisol, which has been linked to memory loss in the elderly.

The study found that one receptor was activated by low levels of cortisol, which helped memory.

However, once levels of the hormone were too high they spilled over on to a second receptor, activating brain processes which contribute to memory impairment.

When the receptor linked to poor memory was blocked, the memory recall problem was reversed.

The experiment based on older mice navigating a maze, was published in the Journal of Neuroscience.

The research helps explain why too much stress over a prolonged period interferes with the normal processes in storing everyday memories.

This is despite the fact that a little bit of stress can help us better remember emotional memories.

Dr Joyce Yau said: 'While we know that stress hormones affect memory, this research explains how the receptors they engage with can switch good memory to poorly-functioning memory in old age.'

 

She added that understanding the mechanisms in the brain, which affect memory as we age, will help find ways to combat conditions linked to memory loss.

The study was funded by the Medical Research Council. 

Professor Chris Kennard, of the MRC, said: 'This research highlights some interesting, original concepts relating to why memory loss occurs in old age.

'With people living ever longer, the MRC is really focussing on research which allows elderly people not just to survive, but also to stay healthy.'

The researchers are looking at a new chemical compound which blocks an enzyme, known as 11beta-HSD1, which helps produce stress hormones within cells.

05-11-011_bbcnews,2011-04-06,Stress 'contributes' to memory loss in old age,"Experts claim to have found how stress can lead to memory loss in old age.

Edinburgh University researchers have shown how two receptors in older brains react to the stress hormone cortisol linked to forgetfulness as people age.

The study on older mice found one receptor was activated by low levels of cortisol, which helped memory.

But once levels of the hormone were too high they spilled over on to a second receptor, activating brain processes which contribute to memory loss.

When the receptor linked to poor memory was blocked, the memory recall problem was reversed.

Scientists say the discovery could lead to treatment for conditions such as early Alzheimer's.

Dr Joyce Yau, who led the study at Edinburgh University's centre for cardiovascular science, said: ""While we know that stress hormones affect memory, this research explains how the receptors they engage with can switch good memory to poorly functioning memory in old age.

""We now know that lowering the levels of these stress hormones will prevent them from activating a receptor in the brain that is bad for memory.

""Understanding the mechanisms in the brain which affect memory as we age will help us to find ways to combat conditions linked to memory loss.""

The scientists said the research helps explain why too much stress over a prolonged period interferes with the normal processes in storing everyday memories, despite the fact that a little bit of stress can help people better remember emotional memories.

Scientists found that high levels of cortisol in aged mice made them less able to remember how to navigate a maze.

The study was published in the Journal of Neuroscience and was funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC).

Academics suggest this could be because it is ""not very comforting"" to live with someone who has grown up ""jittery"".

Prof Pat Monaghan of the University of Glasgow said: ""The take-home message is that the wrong kind of partner can be very bad for your health.

""Other research led us to expect that increased stress exposure in early life would reduce adult lifespan, but we were not expecting such a big effect on breeding partners.

""Unstressed birds had mortality rates that were four times higher than normal if they were simply given partners that had experienced stress earlier in their lives.""

In the experiment, published in the leading science journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, researchers studied zebra finches since they form strong bonds with mates and respond to stress in the same way as humans.

They gave half the birds in the study stress hormones for two weeks when they were chicks, then raised all of the birds in stress-free environments.

Those exposed to stress in early life were later found to be much more sensitive to it as adults compared with the ""laid-back"" finches, which is likely to be bad for the health.

The birds were then given mates and their lifespans were monitored. 

Those that had been stressed-out as chicks had far shorter lives, as did their partners even if they themselves had enjoyed a relaxed start in life.

Prof Monaghan said: ""What we found is that the effect is contagious, but only when the exposure to stress comes early in life. 

""If you extrapolate this to humans, you could hypothesize that during the recession, for instance, someone who suffered stress as an infant may feel the problems more. And this would be bad news for their partner.

03-11-020_telegraph,2011-06-24,"Drug danger: how worried should patients be?

Patients should be aware that all medication has side effects and only take medicines that are really required.","We examined the medication records of over 13,000 people aged 65, or over, and found that the use of medicines with anticholinergic activity – meaning they blocked a chemical in the nervous system called acetylcholine- was linked with an increased risk of both mental impairment and death. 

We had four key findings. First, medicines with anticholinergic activity were widely used, with 48 per cent of the population using one or more. 

Second, the use of anticholinergic medicines was associated with a worsening of brain function. Participants, who had a high level of blockage scored four per cent lower in a standard test for dementia. 

Third, the use of anticholinergic medicines was associated with an increased death rate; over two years 20 per cent of people with a high level of blockage had died compared with seven per cent who did not use the drugs. 

Finally, the risk appeared to be cumulative and related to both the number of anticholinergic medicines taken and the strength of each medicine’s anticholinergic effect. 

What should patients do? 

There are always risks associated with medication and we believe that the findings from our observational study, which require replication, will help patients to make informed decisions. 

Patients should be aware that all medication has side effects and only take medicines that are really required; sometimes people take medicines when they don’t really need them, for example, taking hay fever treatments in the middle of freezing cold winters. 

However, it is vital that anyone, who is concerned, should not panic and continue taking their medicines as usual. If a patient does have any concerns these should be discussed with their doctor, or pharmacist. 

Many older people have regular medication reviews, and such reviews, could incorporate a review of the overall anticholinergic burden. 

To help clinicians with any medication review, patients should bring a list of all medication that they are taking including any medicines purchased over-the-counter from a pharmacy or supermarket, which may have anticholinergic activity. 

People with dementia may be particularly vulnerable because they may not be able to communicate about any side effects, that they may be suffering from, and therefore we believe that such a medication review is particularly important in people with dementia. 

We would also recommend that older people, on multiple medicines, should always discuss self-medication, with over-the-counter medicines, with a pharmacist.",,{},{},,
03-11-020_reuters,2011-06-24,Common drug effect ups elderly death risk: study,"A side effect of many commonly used drugs, including antihistamines and antidepressants, appears to increase the risk of reduced brain function and early death in older people, according to a study published on Friday.

Scientists from Britain's University of East Anglia who led the work said the findings showed it was vital for doctors to regularly review drugs taken by elderly patients to ensure the cumulative risks of side-effects did not outweigh the benefits.

""Our results show a potentially serious effect on mortality,"" Chris Fox, of UEA's Norwich Medical School, told reporters at a briefing in London.

The study, published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, is the first systematic investigation into the long-term impact of anticholinergic activity -- a known potential side-effect of many prescription and over-the-counter drugs which affects the brain by blocking a key neurotransmitter called acetylcholine.

Many common medicines -- including the antihistamine Piriton and antidepressants brands Elavil, Tryptizol, Laroxyl and Anafranil -- have some anticholinergic effect and many are frequently taken by older people.

""One of the issues is that as we age, we tend to be prescribed more medicines which have an anticholinergic effect, increasing the overall burden,"" said Ian Maidment, a mental health pharmacist in Britain's National Health Service (NHS).

""MINIMISE HARM""

The researchers devised a ranking system which they called the AntiCholinergic Burden (ACB) score for the anticholinergic effects of more than 80 common prescription and over-the- counter drugs. They assigned them scores of 0 for no effect, 1 for mild effect, 2 for moderate effect and 3 for severe effect.

They then used this system to analyze more than 13,000 British men and women aged 65 and over for a two-year period.

They found that 20 percent of participants taking drugs with a total ACB of four or more had died by the end of the two-year study, compared with only 7 percent of those taking no anticholinergic drugs. For every extra ACB point, the odds of dying increased by 26 percent, they found.

Those taking drugs with a combined ACB of five or more scored more than 4 percent lower in a cognitive function tests than those taking no anticholinergic drugs -- a finding that confirmed evidence from previous smaller studies of a link between anticholinergics and mental decline.

And the increased risks from taking anticholinergic drugs were found to be cumulative, based on the number of medicines taken and the strength of each drug's anticholinergic effect.

""It's important to scrutinize medications given to older people very carefully to try to minimize harm as well as gain the desired benefit,"" said Carol Brayne of the University of Cambridge, who also worked on the study.

The researchers said other medications with the ABC impact included tranquilizers such as trifluoperazine, sometimes known by the brand name Stelazine, the heart drug nifedipine which is sold in extended release form by Mylan and Bayer, painkillers such as codeine, the common asthma treatment beclometasone, and the epilepsy drug Carbamazepine, sold as Carbatrol by Shire.

Fox said that, wherever possible, doctors should ""avoid prescribing multiple drugs with anticholinergic effects.""

Susanne Sorensen, head of research at the Alzheimer's Society, who was not involved in the study, said its findings must be taken seriously, particularly since loss of cognitive function can be a precursor to the mind-robbing Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.

02-11-031_dailymail,2011-08-04,Haven't we met before? Why we recognise someone's face but struggle to remember their name,"It happens to all of us - you bump into someone you recognise but whose name you simply cannot remember.

Now scientists have identified why we are often unable to link a face with a name.

We stand a much better chance of remembering a name if we have extra clues as to where, or when, we first encountered the person, researchers from the University of Bristol said.



The study found that when we need to remember that a particular object, for example a face, occurred in a particular place, or at a particular time, multiple brain regions have to work together - not independently.

It has been known for some time that three brain regions appear to have specific roles in memory processing.

The perirhinal cortex seems to be critical for our ability to recognise whether an individual object is novel or familiar; the hippocampus is important for recognising places and for navigation; while the medial prefrontal cortex is associated with higher brain functions. 

 

The Bristol researchers, however, are the first to look at situations where these brain regions interact all together, rather than considering each one individually.

Co-lead researcher Dr Clea Warburton said: 'We are very excited to discover this important brain circuit.

'We're now studying how memory information is processed within it, in the hope we can then understand how our own ""internal library"" system works.'

The team investigated the neural basis of our ability to recognise different types of stimuli under different conditions.

Of specific interest were two types of recognition memory: ‘object-in-place recognition memory’ (remembering where we put our keys), and ‘temporal order recognition memory’ (when we last had them). 

Neither ‘object-in-place’ or ‘temporal order recognition’ memories could be formed if communication between the hippocampus and either the perirhinal cortex, or the medial prefrontal cortex, was broken.

In other words, disconnecting the regions prevented the ability to remember both where objects had been, and in which order.

Finding that these regions must all act together has important implications for understanding memory and helping treat people with memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.

15-11-013_dailymail,2011-07-27,BRAIN POWER LIGHTS UP THE DARK NORTH,"FOR Northerners tiring of those old jokes about them being less than bright, help is at hand.

Scientists say the Northern brain is actually bigger than those of the South.

But before Northerners round triumphantly on their pea-brained Southern crictics, big doesn't necessarily mean smarter.

Instead, the extra grey matter simply helps them see clearly in the lower light levels that come with living at high latitudes.

To put it another way, Northern dimness led to the evolution of bigger brains.

The intriguing theory comes from Oxford University scientists who measured the brain volume of 55 skulls from around the world.

Some were English, others came from as far afield as China, Africa and the Pacific Islands.

Plotting brain volume with the geographical location of the person's country clearly showed that the further north they lived, the bigger their brain.

Scandinavians had the most brain power and Pacific Islanders the least.

Measurements of the eye sockets also showed that those from northern climes had bigger eyes.

Finally, the research team showed that the eyesight of those living in the north is just as good as those based near the equator, despite their days being illuminated by less of the sun's light.

Researcher Eiluned Pearce, from the university's school of anthropology, said that this suggests that the bigger brains and eyes are needed to see properly in dimmer light.

'As you move away from the equator, there's less light available, so humans have had to evolve bigger and bigger eyes.

Their brains also need to be bigger to deal with the extra visual input.' 

Northerners, however, should not get too big-headed as the researcher added: 'Having bigger brains doesn't mean that higher latitude humans are smarter, it just means they need bigger brains to be able to see well where they live.'

The study, published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, took into account other factors that could have affected the results, including the fact that people living at higher latitudes are physically bigger over all.

The study did not examine differences in brain size in individual countries, however these are expected to be bigger in long, thin countries such as Brazil and Chile.

But before they get swell heads, it is NOWT to do with them being more intelligent than southerners.

The reason for the tiny difference is that they have to live with less light.

Their brains have evolved - along with slightly larger eyes - simply to cope with it being dim up North.

Eiluned Pearce, of Oxford University's School of Anthropology, explained: ""As you move away from the equator, there's less and less light available, so humans have had to evolve bigger and bigger eyes.

""Their brains also need to be bigger to deal with the extra visual input.""

Scientists say the further away from the equator people live, the more grey matter they have, which some will no doubt be tempted to believe explains the mental aptitude of brainy Northerners like particle physicist Brian Cox, 43, from Chadderton, Lancashire.

The long list could also include former Countdown presenter and maths genius Carol Vorderman, 50, who grew up in Prestatyn, North Wales, or poet William Wordsworth, born in Cockermouth, Cumbria.

The study reveals that the further north people live from the equator, the more likely they are to have larger eyes.

It is thought they are necessary to see in the reduced light levels of the northern hemisphere.

The size of the eye sockets and the part of the brain that deals with sight are therefore bigger.

Researchers measured 55 skulls from museum collections dating to the 1800s, from 12 different populations from across the globe.

They found the size of the brain and eye sockets rose in line with the latitude of the country of origin.

It is not quite a good enough reason for Northerners to get smug, however.

For it is only the part of the brain connected to sight which increases, which doesn't have much effect on our intelligence.

Professor Robin Dunbar, one of the paper's Oxford University authors, said: ""Unfortunately it does not mean that everybody with a bigger brain is a superhero.

""People who live at higher latitudes do seem to have larger brains but this is because the brain's visual processing area at the back of the brain is larger.

""It seems that in the grim north there are lots of dark days and long nights, so the size of the eyeball increases to cope, and the brain also increases to process the information.

It doesn't mean that these people can see any better, just that the eye has adapted to the environment.""

Scientists are looking into whether brain size in live people correlates in the same way.

But Prof Dunbar added: ""This is much more difficult with modern travel as people can move all over the globe, making it difficult to correlate brain size to location.""

Lead researcher Eiluned Pearce, from Oxford University's School of Anthropology, said: ""As you move away from the equator, there's less and less light available, so humans had to evolve bigger eyes.

15-11-013_telegraph,2011-07-27,"It's dim up north, but it gives you a bigger brain; Southerners are smaller-minded, study finds","NORTHERNERS have been given new reason to lord it over their southern counterparts: they are likely to have bigger brains.

But before they start feeling too smug, southerners have the perfect retort: a bigger brain does not make you more intelligent.

An Oxford University study has found that people from countries further from the equator have evolved more grey matter and larger eyes than those from sunnier climes.

This is because living in areas with long, dark winters and cloudy skies means that the eyes and brain have to work harder to process images.

Having wider pupils allows the eyes to take in more light, while a bigger retina is able to distinguish more detail, producing a higher-resolution image.

A bigger brain is required to deal with all the extra information.

Researchers said the findings could theoretically apply to different communities within a particular country, meaning that people in the North of Britain might have larger brains than those in the South.

Northerly populations evolved to cope with short periods of daylight after migrating to Europe and northern Asia up to 40,000 years ago.

Analysis of 55 skulls from 12 countries, dating from the 1800s, showed that those from northern areas had larger eye sockets and brain cavities than those from equatorial regions.

While the English had an average brain capacity of 1.4litres, the figure in Micronesia, which lies very near the equator, was just 1.2litres.

In contrast Scandinavians, the most northerly population tested, had a brain capacity of 1.48litres.

A similar difference was seen in eye volume, with English skulls indicating an average of 26.22ml, compared with 26.83 in Scandinavia and 21.83 in Micronesia.

Eiluned Pearce, a postgraduate student who led the research, said: ""As you move away from the equator, there's less and less light available, so humans have had to evolve bigger and bigger eyes.

Their brains also need to be bigger to deal with the extra visual input.

""Having bigger brains doesn't mean that higher latitude humans are smarter, it just means they need bigger brains to be able to see well where they live.""

Although the tests did not examine differences between skulls from different parts of the same country, Miss Pearce said the data could mean someone that with an entirely Scottish or northern English heritage may have a larger brain and eyes than someone whose ancestors were all from the South.

Any difference would likely be minimal because the difference in light levels between the North and South is slight and interbreeding within Britain would dilute any evolutionary change, she added.

Professor Robin Dunbar, the director of the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology at Oxford, and a coauthor of the study, said: ""Humans have only lived at high latitudes in Europe and Asia for a few tens of thousands of years, yet they seem to have adapted their visual systems surprisingly rapidly to the cloudy skies, dull weather and long winters we experience at these latitudes.""

The study took into account of the fact that people living in more northerly areas were generally bigger built overall and the possibility that eye socket size could also be linked to the need to have more fat to insulate the eyeball in cold weather.

Other research has shown that birds which sing earliest in the dawn chorus have relatively bigger eyes, and animals which are nocturnal have larger eyes than those that eat and forage during the day.

15-11-013_bbcnews,2011-07-27,Dark winters 'led to bigger human brains and eyeballs',"Humans living at high latitude have bigger eyes and bigger brains to cope with poor light during long winters and cloudy days, UK scientists have said.

The Oxford University team said bigger brains did not make people smarter.

Larger vision processing areas fill the extra capacity, they write in the Royal Society's Biology Letters journal.

The scientists measured the eye sockets and brain volumes of 55 skulls from 12 populations across the world, and plotted the results against latitude. 

Lead author Eiluned Pearce told BBC News: ""We found a positive relationship between absolute latitude and both eye socket size and cranial capacity.""

The team, from the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology, used skulls dating from the 1800s kept at museums in Oxford and Cambridge. 

The skulls were from indigenous populations ranging from Scandinavia to Australia, Micronesia and North America. 

Largest brain cavities 

The largest brain cavities came from Scandinavia, while the smallest were from Micronesia. 

Eiluned Pearce said: ""Both the amount of light hitting the Earth's surface and winter day-lengths get shorter as you go further north or south from the equator.

""We found that as light levels decrease, humans are getting bigger eye sockets, which suggests that their eyeballs are getting bigger.

""They are also getting bigger brains, because we found this increase in cranial capacity as well. 

""In the paper, we argue that having bigger brains doesn't mean that high-latitude humans are necessarily smarter.

It's just they need bigger eyes and brains to be able to see well where they live."" 

The work indicates that humans are subject to the same evolutionary trends that give relatively large eyes to birds that sing first during the dawn chorus, or species such as owls that forage at night. 

Co author Prof Robin Dunbar said: ""Humans have only lived at high latitudes in Europe and Asia for a few tens of thousands of years, yet they seem to have adapted their visual systems surprisingly rapidly to the cloudy skies, dull weather and long winters we experience at these latitudes."" 

The team took into account the overall body size of each individual by measuring the foramen magnum - the hole in the base of the skull that attaches to the spinal column. 

They also controlled for the possibility that the larger eye sockets were needed for extra fat around the eyeball to insulate them from freezing temperatures. 

The team intends to do more work on establishing a firm link between eyeball size and enhanced visual processing areas in the brain, and to replicate the link found in the 55 original skulls with further study on specimens from other museums.","{""Biology Letters"": 1}","{""Eiluned Pearce"": 2, ""Robin Dunbar"": 1}","{""Oxford University"": 1, ""the Royal Society's"": 1, ""Biology Letters"": 1, ""BBC News"": 1, ""the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology"": 1}","{""Eiluned Pearce"": 2, ""Robin Dunbar"": 1}","{""Oxford University"": 1, ""the Royal Society's"": 1, ""Biology Letters"": 1, ""the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology"": 1}"
15-11-013_reuters,2011-07-27,"It's dim up North, so people need bigger brains","People from northern parts of the world have evolved bigger brains and larger eyes to help them to cope with long, dark winters and dim skies, scientists said on Wednesday.

Researchers from Oxford University studied the eye sockets and brain capacity of 55 human skulls from 12 different populations across the world and found that the further human populations live from the equator, the bigger their brains.

It's not because they are smarter, however, but because they need bigger vision areas in the brain to cope with the low light levels at high latitudes, the scientists said in a report of their findings in the journal Biology Letters.

""As you move away from the equator, there's less and less light available, so humans have had to evolve bigger and bigger eyes,"" said Eiluned Pearce from Oxford's School of Anthropology, who led the study. 

Their brains also need to be bigger to deal with the extra visual input.

""Having bigger brains doesn't mean that higher latitude humans are smarter, it just means they need bigger brains to be able to see well where they live.""

The skulls used in the study dated back to the 1800s and included samples from indigenous populations of England, Australia, Canary Islands, China, France, India, Kenya, Micronesia, Scandinavia, Somalia, Uganda and the United States.

The researchers plotted the volume of the eye sockets and brain cavities against the latitude of the central point of each individual's country of origin and found that the size of both the brain and the eyes could be directly linked to the latitude of the country.

Oxford's Robin Dunbar, who also worked on the study, said the results showed the speed at which humans had evolved to cope with the challenges of new habitats.

""Humans have only lived at high latitudes in Europe and Asia for a few tens of thousands of years, yet they seem to have adapted their visual systems surprisingly rapidly to the cloudy skies, dull weather and long winters,"" he said.

Scientists have identified eight genes that control levels of a steroid linked to age span.

Less of the steroid is produced by the adrenal gland as a person ages.

Experts will seek ways to make the genes more effective.

Steroid supplements may also help.

Scientists studied 14,846 people from Europe and the US.

Researcher Dr Guangju Zhai, of King's College, London, said it may be possible ""in theory"" to banish wrinkles and other ageing signs.",,"{""Guangju Zhai"": 1}","{""King's College"": 1}","{""Guangju Zhai"": 1}","{""King's College"": 1}"
08-11-008_express,2011-04-15,Found: Genes that hold the secret of longer life,"SCIENTISTS have found eight genes that could help us to live longer, healthier lives.

The key to stop the distressing signs of ageing may lie in a steroid found in blood.

If scientists could alter how this steroid - known as DHEAS - works, then the ageing process could be slowed down.

Until now, there has been no way of knowing what role the steroid plays in ageing.

But Dr Guangju Zhai, from King's College London, whose research team identified the eight vital genes, said the discovery will help scientists gauge how much the steroid is to blame.

He said: ""It has been a mystery how DHEAS functions.

""This new research offers a new insight into how the body controls levels of DHEAS and why it dwindles with age.""

Previous studies have shown that the steroid reaches a peak at around 25 or 30.

But as we get older, levels plummet.

By the time we reach 85 years old it has diminished by 95 per cent.

The steroid has been linked to diseases that occur as we age, such as diabetes and certain cancers.

But it is not clear if it causes us to age, or is a by-product of ageing itself.

The theory has created such excitement in America that supplements containing the steroid are already being added to popular anti-ageing products.

Two of the genes have already been linked to ageing and two others to age-related diseases.

Now the King's College team says it now needs to carry out more detailed studies on the other four genes.

And researchers also need to understand whether different people carry different variants of this gene.

This would mean some people have higher levels of the steroid for longer and so avoid age related ill health for longer.

Understanding this could eventually lead to new treatments to block the process or offer the steroid as a supplement.

""We hope in the future to either manipulate the gene to control DHEAS levels to slow the ageing process and halt disease, or to artificially increase DHEAS with supplements,"" added Dr Zhai.

The research team analysed DHEAS levels and 2.5million genetic variants in 14,846 people across Europe and the USA.

They found eight common genes that control the blood concentration of DHEAS and, importantly, some of these genes are associated with ageing and common age-related diseases such as Type 2 diabetes and lymphoma.

Professor Tim Spector, senior co-author from King's College, said: ""For 50 years we have observed the most abundant circulating steroid in the body with no clue as to its role.

""Now its genes have shown us its importance in many parts of the ageing process.""

The authors published their work in the journal PLoS Genetics.

Last night, other experts welcomed the work but sounded a note of caution that it did not mean the UK was on the verge of producing an anti-ageing pill.

Professor Anne McArdle, of the School of Clinical Sciences at the University of Liverpool, said there was still not hard evidence that DHEAS controlled ageing.

Even then, she said, much more research would be needed to find out how doctors could manipulate it for medicinal use.

""The jury is still out on whether it controls ageing,"" she added.

They are more open to new experiences

Intelligent women 'don't believe they are at risk trying drugs once or twice'","Women with high IQs are far more likely to take cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy in their thirties, a study has found.

Researchers think they are more open to new experiences so are more willing to experiment with illegal substances.

The study by Dr James White from Cardiff University found that women with higher than average IQ scores were twice as likely to have taken drugs such as cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamines in their thirties than those with lower scores.



Dr White looked at the records of 8,000 people dating back to the 1970s who had  all had their IQ measured at the ages of five and ten.

They had also answered questions about whether they had taken any drugs when they were 16 and again when they were 30.

 The study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, found that women aged 30 who had higher than average IQs – between 107 and 150 -  were more than twice as likely to have used illegal substances compared to  those with scores of less than 95.

An average IQ score is 100.



Men with high IQ scores were 50 per cent more likely to have used amphetamines, ecstasy, and several illicit drugs than those with low scores – so the link was  not as strong as amongst women.

Dr White said: 'If we were to speculate it could be that people with high IQs  tend to be more open to new experiences.

Intelligent girls and boys are much more likely than average to take illegal drugs like cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy when they grow up, a study has found.","Scientists think they do so in part as a ""coping strategy"" to avoid bullying from their peers, and partially because they find life boring. 

The effect is more pronounced in girls than boys, with those exhibiting high IQs as children more than twice as likely to have tried cocaine or cannabis by the age of 30, as those of lower intelligence.  

The effect in boys with high IQs is also marked, with them being around 50 per cent more likely to have done so by that age as their less intelligent former classmates. 

A team at Cardiff University analysed data from almost 8,000 people born in one week in April 1970, who were enrolled at birth in the ongoing British Cohort Study, which follows participants through life. 

All these children had their IQs tested between the age of five and 10. 

Drug use, as reported by the participants themselves, was then recorded at 16 and 30 years of age. 

At 16, 7.0 per cent of boys and 6.3 per cent of girls had used cannabis. 

This minority had ""statistically significant higher mean childhood IQ scores"" than non-users, according to the authors of the report, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.

At 30, 35.4 per cent of men and 15.9 per cent of women had used cannabis, while the figures for cocaine were 8.6 and 3.6 per cent respectively. 

The authors noted: ""Across most drugs (except amphetamine in men), men and women who reported using in the past 12 months had a significantly higher childhood IQ score than those who reported no use.""

They concluded: ""High childhood IQ may increase the risk of substance abuse in early adulthood.""

The study did not look into why this was the case, although it did not fine any relationship between the social class of the participants' parents and future drug use. 

However, the authors noted that other studies suggested ""intellectually 'gifted children' [with an IQ higher than 130] report high levels of boredom and being stigmatised by peers, either of which could conceivably increase vulnerability to using drugs as an avoidant coping strategy"". 

Dr James White of Cardiff University's Centre for Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions for Public Health Understanding, said: ""Although it is not yet clear exactly why there should be a link between high IQ and illicit drug use, previous research has shown that people with a high IQ are more open to new experiences and keen on novelty and stimulation.""","{""Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health"": 1}","{""James White"": 1}","{""Cardiff University"": 1, ""British Cohort Study"": 1, ""the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health"": 1, ""Cardiff University's"": 1, ""Centre for Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions for Public Health Understanding"": 1}",,"{""Cardiff University"": 2, ""British Cohort Study"": 1, ""the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health"": 1, ""Cardiff University's"": 1, ""Centre for Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions for Public Health Understanding"": 1}"

Details from hospitals such as the location, time, and weapons involved in incidents - provided anonymously so no victims could be identified - were shared with police and led to a 'substantial and significant reduction' in violence in a four-year study in Cardiff.

The scheme led to 42 per cent fewer woundings compared with 14 similar cities in England and Wales.

Now the World Health Organistion has called for the initiative to be rolled out in other countries, 

The study, published on BMJ.com, also showed that the reduction was accompanied by an increase in minor assaults which did not result in injuries, suggesting 'that more accurate targeting led to faster and more frequent police intervention'.

Professor Jonathan Shepherd, who led the Cardiff Violence Prevention Programme, said officers could use the information from A&E departments, much of which currently goes unreported to the police, to deploy their resources more effectively.

In an accompanying editorial, Alexander Butchart, of the World Health Organisation, said: 'In light of its large effect on preventing violence, this model will hopefully be emulated by other cities in developing and developed countries.'

Professor Shepherd told MailOnline: 'It's hugely encouraging to see the scheme is obviously making a difference - it's keeping people out of hospitals and out of prisons.

'It is also a low-tech scheme which doesn't depend on some fancy medicine which costs a fortune. 

'It's just sharing of information, which costs next to nothing.

'If A&Es aren't using this scheme, people should ask why not.

The information used also isn't personal, so none of it can be used to identify any victims.

'The data enables police to be at violence hot spots more frequently and therefore to intervene earlier and more frequently than they would otherwise have done.'

Prof Shepherd, of Cardiff University, said officers were able to identify a particular nightclub or bar where there was habitual violence but no one had contacted the police.

They could then make sure they intervened more quickly, stopped the violence sooner or reviewed a venue's licence.

The study found 'information sharing and use were associated with a substantial and significant reduction in hospital admissions related to violence'.

The authors said: 'Our findings suggest that communities can achieve substantial reductions in the public health burden of violence through organised data driven partnerships between health, law enforcement agencies, and local government.

Officers have cut the number of violent incidents, from fist fights to stabbings, by over 40 per cent by counting where they occur according to the records of those admitted to hospital.

The police then focused resources on those areas.

The results were compared with 14 similar cities and showed that targeting police intervention reduced incidents by 42 per cent.

Hospital admissions for injuries caused by violence in the city fell from seven to five a month, while in the comparison cities, admissions rose from five to eight a month.

The researchers, led by Jonathan Shepherd, professor of oral and maxillofacial surgery at the University of Cardiff - whose findings are published in the British Medical Journal - say that while rates of woundings fell significantly there was an increase in common assaults which did not cause injury.

""One plausible explanation for these findings is that more accurate targeting of hotspots, earlier and more frequent police [investigation], and better deployment of CCTV led to faster and more frequent police intervention in assaults and their precursors (such as arguments),"" the research said.

""The increased presence of police at hotspots could also have led to increased reporting of common assaults by witnesses and victims and subsequent recording by police.""

The scheme is being rolled out across the UK following a pledge by the Coalition government to promote the sharing of information on violence between hospitals and the police.

In 2008-9, police recorded over 900,000 violent incidents in England and Wales.

It is estimated that violence resulted in medical and lost productivity costs of over £2bn.

The precise location, time and weapons used were recorded in the study over four years.

The information has to be anonymised to protect the identity of the injured who might otherwise be deterred from seeking medical help.

Almost half of the babies were born prematurely – some at just 28 weeks – so the team were able to compare the responses of babies in the final stages of development with those of babies born at full term.

Premature babies up to the age of 35 weeks had bursts of activity across the whole brain in response to both pain and touch, but a change happened around 35 weeks.

Between 35 to 37 weeks – just before a fetus would normally be born – the brain seemed to become able to tell the two stimuli apart.

The responses to both pain and touch now took place in specific areas on the front, back and sides of the brain, but the signal was much stronger for pain.

Welcome to pain

""This is an important stage in the development of the brain,"" says Fabrizi, when changes occur to allow the brain to process sensory stimulation in a more sophisticated way in preparation for life outside the womb.

Fabrizi believes that the general bursts of brain activity experienced by developing fetuses are part of that development – they help connections to form between neurons in the brain.

That could be a reason to treat premature babies with even more care than usual: ""By evoking [bursts of brain activity] when the baby is born prematurely we may be interfering with the normal wiring in the brain,"" Fabrizi says, adding that premature babies can be subjected to up to 10 painful procedures a day in hospital.

This might explain why children born prematurely have been found to have abnormal pain responses, although the long-term effects remain unclear, says Fabrizi.

15-11-018_telegraph,2011-11-09,"Origins of human social networks discovered; Humans are sociable creatures because our primate ancestors were forced to band together for protection when they stopped being nocturnal, scientists claim.","Primates were originally solitary creatures which lived alone and foraged by night, but millions of years ago they switched their habits to become active during the day. 

Moving around in daylight put them at greater risk of predators, so they quickly formed groups to reduce their chance of being attacked. 

Precious theories suggested that primate social groups built up gradually in size over time, but new research published in the Nature journal suggests the origin of our sociability can be traced to the switch to daytime activity. 

Oxford University researchers studied groups of living primates as well information on the evolutionary relationships of 217 other primate species to put together the most likely picture of how grouping behaviour developed. 

They found that primates inherited their social behaviour from their ancestors, with more closely related species behaving more similarly to one another. 

But unlike other primates, humans are flexible enough to live in a range of different social settings, with a great variety of social groupings such as nuclear families, extended families and monogamous and polygamous relationships. 

Dr Suzanne Shultz, who led the study, published in the Nature journal, said: ""This flexibility in the human lineage has not evolved to anything like this level in other primates.

Our findings support previous studies that suggest that more brain power is needed for groups that have a more complicated social life.""","{""Nature journal"": 2}","{""Suzanne Shultz"": 1}","{""Oxford University"": 1}","{""Suzanne Shultz"": 1}","{""Oxford University"": 1}"
15-11-018_bbcnews,2011-11-10,Primates leapt to social living,"Scientists may be a step closer to understanding the origins of human social behaviour.

An analysis of over 200 primate species by a University of Oxford team suggests that our ancestors gave up their solitary existence when they shifted from being nocturnal creatures to those that are active during the day. 

It is likely communal living was adopted to protect against day time predators, the researchers say. 

The results are published in Nature. 

From work on social insects and birds, some biologists have suggested that social groups begin to form when young do not leave their natal ground, but instead hang around and help raise their siblings. 

Now, the latest evidence from primates suggests that this might not have been the case for our ancestors. 

Leaping to sociality 

By looking at whether closely related species share similar social structures, the Oxford team of evolutionary biologists shows that a common history is important in shaping the way animals behave in a group. 

The team pinpointed the shift from non-social to social living to about 52 million years ago; a switch that appears to have happened in one step, and coincided with a move into daylight. 

It did coincide with a change in family dynamics or female bonding, which emerged much later at about 16 million years ago. 

""If you are a small animal active at night then your best strategy to avoid predation is to be difficult to detect,"" explained Oxford's Suzanne Shultz, who led the study.

""Once you switch to being active during the day, that strategy isn't very effective, so an alternative strategy to reduce the risk of being eaten is to live in social groups,"" she told BBC News. 

Dr Shultz thinks that the move to day-time living in ancient primates allowed animals to find food more quickly, communicate better, and travel faster through the forest.

The link between sociality and a switch to daytime living might have been missed until now, she suspects, because biologists interested in this question have tended to work with Old World monkeys, like baboons, which are characterised by female bonded groups, which are not characteristic of many primate species.

Flexibly social 

Human societies likely descended from similar large, loosely aggregated creatures, Dr Shultz explained, but the key difference, she pointed out, is that our closest cousins' societies do not vary within a species, while humans' do.

""In human societies we have polygyny... we have monogamy, and in some places we have females leaving the group they were born in, and in others males leave,"" she said.

The research, funded by Sheffield Kidney Association and the National Institute for Health Research, has shown cholesterol deposits in the artery wall are increased by a higher phosphate diet.

This leads to narrowing of the arteries which causes most heart attacks and strokes.

While some had been vaccinated or had caught a similar infection years earlier, most had swine flu, according to researchers at Edinburgh University.Ê

Extrapolated across the country, this means 20 times more people had the H1N1 virus than estimated, even if it was so mild that many were not aware they had it.Ê

Almost 500 Britons were killed when it first struck, with another 600 dying last winter.

People in the most deprived areas were almost twice as likely to catch the bug, the journal PLoS ONE reports.Ê

Professor Mark Woolhouse, of the university's Centre for Infectious Diseases, said: 'It was pretty unexpected.

15-11-021_telegraph,2011-12-07,True colours: we only love art if we're told to,"MANY of us like to think that our deep appreciation of great art demonstrates sophisticated and refined tastes, although others have long had their suspicions to the contrary.

Now the pretentiousness of art lovers who say they are moved by the talent of great painters has been laid bare by a study suggesting that we like paintings only if we are told they are by an Old Master.

Most of us are just as impressed by fakes, so long as they are presented as the real thing, said researchers.

The experiment suggests that people rarely make their own decisions about art and that appreciation is strongly linked to the accompanying information, rather than an objective judgment.

It adds weight to the concept of the emperor's new clothes, as well as supporting Private Eye's satirical view of art lovers in Pseuds Corner as pretentious bores.

The researchers from Oxford University found that reactions to art are ""not rational"" because viewers are influenced by what they are told about a piece of work, regardless of whether it is genuine.

In the study, 14 people were attached to a brain scanner and shown 50 ""Rembrandt"" portraits, some of which were authentic and some of which were convincing fakes.

While their brain signals showed they could not differentiate between the real and fake work, their response altered significantly depending on whether they were told it was a genuine Rembrandt or not.

Prof Martin Kemp, Emeritus Professor of the History of Art at Oxford University, said: ""Ourfindings support what art historians, critics and the general public have long believed - that it is always better to think we are seeing the genuine article.

""Our study shows that the way we view art is not rational, that even when we cannot distinguish between two works, the knowledge that one was painted by a renowned artist makes us respond to it very differently.

""The fact that people travel to galleries around the world to see an original painting suggests that this conclusion is reasonable.""

When volunteers were told a work was genuine, it activated a response in the area of their brains associated with reward and pleasure, researchers found.

But being told a painting was not by Rembrandt triggered a variety of responses in parts of the brain linked to trying to understand.

Those taking part said they found themselves studying paintings in these cases, trying to establish why they were not considered genuine.

The findings are published in the Frontiers in Human Neuroscience journal.

06-11-025_dailymail,2011-12-01,WHY MOTHERS-TO-BE SHOULD AVOID A HIGH STREET COFFEE,"PREGNANT women could unwittingly be putting the health of their unborn baby at risk by drinking coffee from high street cafes, researchers warn.

An analysis of espressos from 20 coffee shops uncovered huge variations in the amount of caffeine they contain Z with the strongest having more than six times as much as the weakest.

Worryingly, the strongest example contained more than 50 per cent more caffeine in a single cup than a pregnant woman is advised to take over the course of an entire day.

Fears about birth defects, miscarriage and premature delivery mean that pregnant women are advised to limit themselves to 200mg of caffeine a day. 

This is usually the equivalent of four cups of strong coffee, expected to contain 50mg of caffeine each.

But only one of the 20 coffees studied Z the one from Starbucks Z contained around this amount. All of the others were stronger.

Four had more than 200mg in a single cup, with the strongest having more than 300mg, the Royal Society of Chemistry journal Food and Function reports.

Researchers from Glasgow University bought single-shot espressos from 20 coffee shops in the city and measured their caffeine content.

The Starbucks espresso was the weakest, with 51mg of caffeine. 

In contrast, espresso from Costa Coffee had more than three times as much caffeine, with a reading of 157mg. 

At the top of the table was the espresso from Patisserie Francoise in the city's West End Z with 322mg of caffeine.

Repeating the experiment several times did not change the figures.

Researcher Alan Crozier said caffeine, which crosses the placenta to the unborn baby, usually takes five hours to break down in the body to half its previous level.

But the process can take up to 30 hours in certain groups, including children, liver disease sufferers and pregnant women. 

An unborn baby's liver will struggle to break down caffeine, with potential long-term consequences. 

Even taking the Pill can hamper processing of caffeine.

Dr Crozier, a senior research fellow at Glasgow University's school of medicine, said: 'The levels of caffeine per serving varied more than six-fold. 

At the low level, a pregnant woman might safely drink four cups per day without significantly exceeding the recommended intake.

'At the higher end of the scale, even one cup of espresso will be well in excess of the advised limit.

'There is clearly a problem. People at risk could unwittingly ingest far more caffeine than they would ever dream of.'

Dr Crozier said the type of bean, the roasting process, grinding conditions and the coffee-making technique can all affect caffeine content, as well as the actual amount of coffee used.

He called for current guidelines on caffeine, from the Food Standards Agency, to be tightened and stricter monitoring of caffeine content.

A study of other coffees such as lattes and cappuccinos is also warranted, he said, as they are often made from an even stronger espresso base. 

He added: 'There is every possibility this applies to all coffee shop coffees and not just espresso and not just in Glasgow.'

A spokesman for Starbucks said: 'It is nothing new that caffeine is bad for pregnant women. 

We offer decaffeinated espressos in our stores. 

The quantity of caffeine doesn't necessarily mean the coffee tastes weak.' Patisserie Francoise was unable to comment.

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) recommends no more than 300mg of caffeine a day for pregnant women.

The Food Standards Agency, though, recommends just 200mg daily throughout pregnancy.

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) backs this figure but also recommends that women should also recommends complete abstention in the first three months.

A coffee in one shop can contain six times more caffeine than those bought in others, according to researchers from Glasgow University, who analysed levels in 20 premises. 

They found that a single espresso in one independent cafe contained 322mg, while one from Starbucks had just 51mg, the lowest of the 20.

RCOG spokeswoman Dr Daghni Rajasingam said excess caffeine in pregnancy had been linked to an increased risk of a mother delivering a small baby or having a miscarriage. 

Small babies are at greater risk of developing heart problems and cardiovascular disease later in life, she added.

Pregnant women should be aware that the caffeine content of coffee varies from shop to shop, should ask how strong a coffee is before they buy it and do their best to keep their intake down to no more than 300mg a day, and only after the first trimester, said Rajasingham.

Medical experts warned that the differences were potentially putting pregnant women at greater risk of miscarriage. 

They found that café customers were unaware of the wide variations in caffeine levels. 

The findings suggest that the general assumption that a cup of strong coffee contains 50mg of caffeine is misleading. 

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) advises pregnant women to restrict their daily caffeine content to 200mg. 

In their study, Glasgow University researchers found a sixfold difference in caffeine quantities in cups of espresso. 

Their analysis, from 20 shops in the city, found that a cup bought from Starbucks contained the smallest amount of caffeine, 51mg. 

This compared with 322mg from an independent café, Patisserie Françoise. An espresso from Costa contained 157mg. 

A further three shops, University Café, Café Cinnamon and Paperino's, sold coffee containing more than 200mg. 

The FSA warns that too much caffeine can result in a miscarriage or a baby having a lower birth weight. 

The researchers warned that, without clear labelling, coffee shops were selling coffees with ""substantial variations"" in caffeine. 

In 2008 American researchers found that women who drank more than 200mg of caffeine daily were at a 25 per cent greater risk of miscarriage in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy than those who drank none. 

Alan Crozier, from Glasgow University's School of Medicine, said: ""Despite the increasing number of coffee shops on the high street and in airports, there appear to be no recent publications on the caffeine contents of the various types of commercially prepared coffees. 

""This snapshot of high street espresso coffees suggests the published assumption that a cup of strong coffee contains 50mg of caffeine may be misleading.

""Our data represent only a snap-shot of the caffeine contents of espresso coffees, but the range and scale of the results is sufficient to demonstrate that there is a problem, unlikely to be restricted to Glasgow.""

Researchers analysed coffees ranging in cup size from 23ml to 70ml. Their findings are published in the Royal Society of Chemistry's Food and Function journal. 

Dr Euan Paul, of the British Coffee Association said: ""Caffeine content does vary between different blends that are available. 

""The overall advice for coffee drinkers is that 400mg to 500mg of caffeine per day is safe and may confer some health benefits but it's important that pregnant women do limit their intake to 200mg per day, from all sources. 

""For pregnant women that are concerned, switching to decaff coffee will ensure that they are drinking less caffeine whilst still enjoying their cup of coffee.""

Experts say the effects of caffeine usually last around five hours for adults but can be as long as 30 hours. 

Scientists say caffeine stays in the body longer in females taking an oral contraceptive, pregnant women, young children and people with liver disease. 

Responses to caffeine vary with frequent coffee drinkers suffering headaches when caffeine is withdrawn.

06-11-025_bbcnews,2011-12-01,Coffee shop caffeine levels 'vary widely',"High Street coffee shops could pose a risk to pregnant women because of big variations in the amount of caffeine in each cup, research suggests. 

Analysis of espresso coffee from 20 shops found that one was six times stronger than others. 

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) says too much caffeine can result in miscarriage or a low birth weight. 

Researchers from Glasgow University tested caffeine levels in espressos bought from High Street coffee shops.

The FSA currently advises pregnant women to consume no more than 200mg of caffeine a day, based on an assumption that an espresso contains about 50mg of caffeine. 

The guideline for an average healthy person is 300mg a day.

The work was led by Alan Crozier, senior research fellow in the faculty of medicine.

How much coffee is safe? 

""The analysis that we did showed the amount of caffeine ranged from 50mg per cup from Starbucks, up to over 300mg per cup from another coffee house, Patisserie Francoise,"" he said. ""I was very surprised by this.""

Drinking just one of the strongest cups of coffee would more than exceed the ""safe"" level for pregnant women.

""If you go to different coffee houses you can tell that some are much stronger than others,"" Mr Crozier said.

""The problem comes with people who should have a limited caffeine intake.

""You metabolise caffeine much more slowly when you're pregnant and people with liver disease do not have the enzymes to metabolise caffeine.

""Our data shows that you can have the recommended amount - and more - from just one shot of espresso.""

The researchers point out that despite the increasing number of coffee shops on the High Street there is no information about the caffeine contents of various types of coffee.

They add that, although they only tested espresso coffees, many other types of drinks such as lattes and cappuccinos are prepared using single or double shots of espresso.

07-11-001_express,2011-01-17,Arthritis 'trigger' found,"A NEW treatment for rheumatoid arthritis is a step closer following the discovery of a ""master switch"" which triggers the condition.

Rheumatoid arthritis, which affects 350,000 in Britain, is an incurable immune system disease where joints are swollen by inflammation.

The body uses inflammation as a defence against infection and tissue damage, but too much is harmful.

Scientists at Imperial College London have found a protein called IRF5 that acts as a switch, telling immune system cells, called macrophages, to promote or stop inflammation.

Blocking the production of IRF5 could help in a range of diseases including RA, lupus and even MS.

A treatment called anti-TNF drugs developed at the college previously is ineffective in 30 per cent of cases.

Senior researcher Dr Irina Udalova said: ""This is really exciting.""",,"{""Irina Udalova"": 1}","{""Imperial College London"": 1}","{""Irina Udalova"": 1}","{""Imperial College London"": 1}"
07-11-001_reuters,2011-01-17,"Scientists find inflammation immune cell switch

* Study identifies protein called IRF5 as ""master switch""

* Findings could lead to new drugs for rheumatoid arthritis","LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Scientists have found a protein that acts as a ""master switch"" to determine whether certain white blood cells will boost or dampen inflammation, a finding that may help the search for new drugs for rheumatoid arthritis.

Many patients with rheumatoid arthritis are treated with a class of drugs known as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors made by various drug firms including Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), Merck & Co (MRK.N), Pfizer (PFE.N) and Amgen (AMGN.O)

But around 30 percent of patients don't respond to anti-TNF drugs, so experts say there is an urgent need to develop more widely effective treatment options.

In this study, scientists from Imperial College in London found that a protein called IRF5 acts as a molecular switch that controls whether certain white blood cells, known as macrophages, will promote or inhibit inflammation.

In a report of their findings in the journal Nature Immunology on Sunday, they said the results suggest that blocking the production of IRF5 in macrophages might be an effective way of treating a wide range of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, lupus and multiple sclerosis. 

They also suggest that boosting IRF5 levels might help treat people whose immune systems are weak, compromised or damaged.

""Our results show that IRF5 is the master switch in a key set of immune cells, which determines the profile of genes that get turned on in those cells,"" Irina Udalova, senior researcher on the study, said in a statement.

""This is really exciting because it means that if we can design molecules that interfere with IRF5 function, it could give us new anti-inflammatory treatments for a wide variety of conditions.""

The researchers said IRF5 seems to work by switching on genes that stimulate inflammatory responses and dampening genes that inhibit them. 

It can do this either by interacting with DNA directly, or by interacting with other proteins that themselves control which genes are switched on, they explained in their study.

Udalova's team is now studying how IRF5 works at a molecular level and which other proteins it interacts with so that they can design ways to block its effects.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting around 1 percent of the world's population and arises when the immune system mistakenly attacks joints all over the body. As well as joints, it may also affect the skin, heart, lungs, kidneys and blood vessels. Many sufferers get deformed hands and feet, which hamper movement and ability to function.

HORROR MOVIES

IT will come as no surprise to any woman who has watched Psycho through her fingers Ð or any man who has sat beside her revelling in every gory detail.

Women get more scared during horror films than men do, a study has revealed.

And it's all because they are more likely to anticipate the scary scenes that lie ahead.

When given warning of extreme violence or horror, women's brains quickly leap into action, while men's stay calm until the event unfolds.

The finding comes from University College London researchers who studied how the sexes anticipate unpleasant events.

Thirty men and women had their brain activity measured as they viewed pictures of positive and negative scenes, such as peaceful landscapes or extreme violence.

They were given a clue to the nature of the pictures in advance, with a smiling face indicating a happy scene was on the way and sad face heralding a harrowing image.

After viewing the pictures, they underwent memory tests.

The results showed that the mere anticipation of something bad was enough to kick women's brains into action Ð but not men's.

This means, for instance, that the screeching violins, violas and cellos leading up to the murder in the shower in Psycho are likely to make women move to the edge of their seat, but men won't react until they actually see the horror unfold.

Lead researcher Dr Giulia Galli said: 'When expecting a negative experience, women might have higher emotional responsiveness than men, indicated by their brain activity.

'This is likely to then affect how they remember the negative event.

'What matters for men instead is mostly the brain activity while watching the scene.'

The study also showed that the greater a woman's anticipation of the horrors, the better she remembered them afterwards.

Writing in The Journal of Neuroscience, the researchers said: 'From an evolutionary perspective, anticipating an aversive event may help an individual prepare reactions in threatening situations.

'In everyday life, however, excessive anticipation of future harm may lead to psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression.'

Thirty men and women had their brain activity measured as they viewed positive and negative pictures, such as nice landscapes and extreme violence.

They were given a clue to the picture in advance, such as a smiley face for a positive image and a sad face for a disturbing one.

03-11-027_times,2011-08-11,Genetic insight to origins of MS,"A clutch of 29 genetic variants that raise a person's risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been found by scientists, more than doubling the number linked to the disease and providing insights that could lead to new treatments.

The genetic study could resolve a longstanding debate about the origins of the degenerative neurological condition, providing strong new evidence that it begins with inflammation that triggers damage to nerve cells.

This discovery suggests that drugs designed to damp down the immune system and limit inflammation are likely to be the most effective method of controlling MS and preventing further degeneration of the nervous system.

""This study says that this is the right approach, that this is the way to nail this disease,"" said Professor Alastair Compston, of the University of Cambridge, who led the international study with Professor Peter Donnelly, director of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics at the University of Oxford.

The findings, published in the journal Nature, could also have implications for understanding and treating other auto-immune and inflammatory conditions, including Crohn's disease, coeliac disease and rheumatoid arthritis.

A third of the genes identified have already been linked to such disorders.","{""Nature"": 1}","{""Alastair Compston"": 1, ""Peter Donnelly"": 1}","{""the University of Cambridge"": 1, ""the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics"": 1, ""the University of Oxford"": 1}","{""Alastair Compston"": 1, ""Peter Donnelly"": 1}","{""the University of Cambridge"": 1, ""the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics"": 1, ""the University of Oxford"": 1}"
03-11-027_guardian,2011-08-11,Multiple sclerosis genes identified in biggest ever study: List of variants linked to MS is doubled by research Majority of cells involved are within immune system,"Scientists have discovered 29 new gene variants that are implicated in multiple sclerosis, following the largest ever study of the genetics of the disease.

The genes are involved in controlling parts of the body's immune system, confirming research strategies and pointing to possible treatments for people who develop MS.

The discoveries more than double the list of parts of the human genome that researchers believe contribute to the disease.

MS is one of the most common diseases of the nervous system, affecting more than 2.5 million people around the world.

It is caused by damage to the protective insulation around nerve fibres, called the myelin sheath, preventing the nerves from working properly.

This can affect everyday activities including sight, walking, thinking and control of organs.

In the latest study, led by Alastair Compston from the University of Cambridge, scientists looked at 600,000 locations in the DNA from 9,772 people with MS and compared it with those of 17,376 unrelated healthy people.

It is the largest-ever study into the disease, involving 250 researchers in the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium and the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. The results were published yesterday in Nature.

The first gene to be linked to MS, called HLA, was found in the early 1970s.

Since then, several more genes have been implicated.

In the Nature paper, researchers confirmed the involvement of 23 previously suspected gene variants and found 29 new variants.

A further five variants were identified as strong candidates for future studies of the disease.

""The genes implicated by these 57 regions tell a very coherent story,"" said Compston. ""There is a narrative that goes across these which is extremely informative - the story is immunological - 80% of the genes within the regions implicated are intimately involved in the workings of the immune response.

This puts immunology right at the front end of the disease, unambiguously.""

Many of the genes identified by Compston's team are involved in the function of T-cells, a type of immune cell that is responsible for destroying foreign invaders.

Of the new gene variants found for MS, around a third have already been linked to a range of autoimmune conditions, where the T-cells malfunction and start attacking the body's own cells, such as Crohn's disease and Type 1 diabetes.

The findings also confirm research scientists had already been pursuing.

Four of the gene variants for MS are directly associated with drugs that are either already licensed or in clinical trials.

Peter Donnelly, a co-author of the research and head of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics at Oxford University, said the study still did not reveal the complete picture.

""Our best guess at this is that, collectively, now the variants explain about 20% of the heritability,"" he said.

""The rest will be down to a multitude of as-yet-undiscovered gene variants, each adding a tiny percentage to the overall risk of developing the disease.""

Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the MS Society said: ""By identifying which genes may trigger the development of MS, we can identify potential 'risk factors' and look at new ways of treating, or even preventing, the condition in the future.

They hope the findings will provide a pathway to effective therapies for a wide range of conditions, such as Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and insulin-dependent diabetes.

All are diseases in which cells are attacked by the body's own immune system.

In the case of MS, the fatty myelin sheath that protects and insulates nerve fibres is eroded.

As a result nerve messages become disrupted, leading to symptoms ranging from tingling to paralysis.

An international team of scientists, including British researchers, identified 29 new genetic variants linked to MS, almost doubling the number previously known.

Many of the suspect genes play pivotal roles in the workings of the immune system, in particular the functions of T-cells, the white blood cells that attack foreign invaders or marshal other elements of the body's defences.

The findings were published last week in the journal Nature.

A second study in the online journal Public Library of Science Genetics pointed to common genetic links between auto-immune diseases.

Dr Chris Cotsapas, one of the lead authors from the Yale School of Medicine in the US, said: ""We have known for some time that many devastating diseases of the immune system must have common genetic causes.

""Now we have the outline of a map that tells us where we can look for common treatments.""

MS affects about 100,000 people in Britain.

03-11-027_independent,2011-08-11,Multiple sclerosis study identifies genetic causes; MS is one of the most common neurological conditions in young adults but there is a debate about how it is triggered,"One of the biggest studies ever undertaken into multiple sclerosis has identified 29 new genetic factors that are implicated in the development of the disease.

The nature of the genes that have been linked with MS has demonstrated with a high degree of certainty that the root causes of the illness can be traced to the faulty functioning of the body's immune system, scientists said.

Nearly 10,000 individuals with multiple sclerosis took part in the study and their genomes were scanned to find the genetic differences with the DNA of over 17,000 healthy people.

The total number of genetic faults linked with the disease now amounts to 57.

Alastair Compston, of the University of Cambridge, one of the lead authors of the study published in Nature, said there have been rival theories about what are the important factors implicated in triggering the disease, one of the most common neurological conditions affecting young adults.

""Our research settles a long-standing debate on what happens first in the complex sequences of events that leads to disability in multiple sclerosis,"" he said.

""This has important implications for future treatment strategies.

It puts immunology right at the front end of the disease, absolutely.""

The study involved a relatively new technique called genome-wide scanning, which involves analysing the entire length of a patient's DNA for anomalies that appear not to exist in healthy people and could therefore be linked with the disease.

Previous research had established that multiple sclerosis has a strong genetic component.

Some of the newly identified genes are known to be involved in the immune system and some have also been linked with other auto-immune diseases, where the immune defences start to attack the body's own cells and tissues, said Professor Peter Donnelly of Oxford University, who was involved in the research.

In a parallel study, American scientists have identified a similar array of genes involved in multiple sclerosis, which the researchers said could open the way to new drugs and treatments.

A team of international researchers has identified 29 genetic variations linked to MS - doubling the number known about.

As well as creating new targets for MS treatments, experts hope the findings could lead to ways of tackling related conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and Type 1 diabetes.

These ""autoimmune disorders"" are caused when cells are attacked by the body's immune system.

The research was welcomed by campaigners in Scotland, where 10,500 people have been diagnosed with MS - believed to be the highest rate per population in the world.

MS affects around 100,000 people in the UK and 2.5 million worldwide, making it one of the most common neurological conditions among young adults.

In patients with MS, nerve fibres are damaged, disrupting the messages they send to the brain and causing symptoms ranging from tingling and numbness to paralysis.

For the latest study, published in the journal Nature, researchers compared DNA from 9,772 MS patients with that from 17,376 unrelated healthy individuals.

A third of the MS genes they identified had been implicated in other autoimmune diseases, including Crohn's and diabetes.

Dr Chris Cotsapas, one of the lead authors from the Yale School of Medicine in the US, said: ""We have known for some time that many devastating diseases of the immune system must have common genetic causes.

Now we have the outline of a map that tells us where we can look for common treatments.""

Previous research has also suggested a link between low vitamin D - produced by the body when exposed to sunlight - and an increased of MS.

Some have said that this could explain why Scotland, with few daylight hours in winter, may have more MS cases.

The new study identified two MS genes linked to the way the body handles vitamin D, adding increased evidence of a possible link between genetic and environmental risk factors for MS.

Leading British author Professor Alastair Compston, from Cambridge University, co-founder of the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium, said: ""Identifying the basis for genetic susceptibility to any medical condition provides reliable insights into the disease mechanisms.

03-11-027_bbcnews,2011-08-10,Genetic clues to what triggers MS,"Around 30 genetic risk factors for developing multiple sclerosis have been discovered by a UK-led team.

It brings to more than 50 the total number of genetic clues to the disease.

The research, published in Nature, will help identify risk factors and perhaps future treatments or even a cure, said the MS Society.

Most of the genes are linked to immunity, backing the idea that the disease is triggered when the immune system turns against itself.

Genes are only part of the story, however, with other factors, such as vitamin D deficiency or a viral infection, thought to play an important role.

The study, carried out by a consortium of international researchers, led by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, is the largest yet into genes and MS.

It looked at DNA from almost 10,000 MS patients, and more than 15,000 healthy controls.

Twenty three known genetic variations, common in the general population, that give a tiny increase in the risk of getting MS were confirmed, and 29 new ones identified.

Another five are strongly suspected as being involved, bringing the total number of genetic variations associated with MS to 57.

Professor Alistair Compston of the University of Cambridge told the BBC: ""This is suddenly a big new number of genes to try to understand. 

""80% of the genes that are implicated by the 57 'hits' are immunological.

This shouts out that this is an immunological disease at the beginning.

This is a very important confirmation.""

Around 2.5 million people around the world have MS, 100,000 of them in the UK.

MS is not directly inherited and there is no single gene that causes it.

However, research suggests a combination of genes common in the general population make some people more susceptible to developing the neurological disorder.

Other factors are involved, possibly something in the environment, such as an infection or bacteria, or lack of Vitamin D. 

Simon Gillespie, Chief Executive of the MS Society said: ""By identifying which genes may trigger the development of MS, we can identify potential 'risk factors' and look at new ways of treating, or even preventing, the condition in the future.""

03-11-027_reuters,2011-08-10,Scientists unravel genetic clues to multiple sclerosis,"Scientists have found 29 new genetic variants linked to multiple sclerosis (MS) and say the findings should help drugmakers focus treatment research on precise areas of the immune system.

In a study published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, researchers said the newly-found links point to the idea that T-cells -- a type of white blood cell responsible for mounting an immune response -- and chemicals called interleukins play a key role in the development of the debilitating disease.

Drugs in development that target the immune system include rituximab, sold under the brand name Rituxan by Roche and Biogen to fight leukemia, Tysabri from Biogen and Elan, Lemtrada, sold as Campath by Sanofi's unit Genzyme for cancer, and Abbott and Biogen's Zenapax or daclizumab.

""We have implicated genes that are highly relevant to the actions of those drugs,"" said Alastair Compston of Cambridge University, who co-led the study.

""It is now clear that multiple sclerosis is primarily an immunological disease.

This is the way to nail this disease and get on top of it.""

Mid-stage trial data for daclizumab released on Tuesday showed the drug on a par with other new medicines for MS, but some of he side-effects were worrisome.

Multiple sclerosis is one of the most common neurological conditions among young adults, affecting around 2.5 million people worldwide.

It occurs when the protective coating, known as the myelin sheath, around nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord begins to break down, slowing the brain's communication with the rest of the body.

The affected pathways -- responsible for everyday activities such as seeing, walking, feeling, thinking and controlling the bowel and bladder -- lose the ability to function properly and are eventually destroyed.

In a second study in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS Genetics on Wednesday, researchers found that many of the genes linked to MS are also linked to other autoimmune diseases such as Crohn's disease and Type 1 diabetes.

This also points to potential new uses for existing drugs in development, they said.

""We have known for some time that many devastating diseases of the immune system must have common genetic causes,"" said Chris Cotsapas of Yale University in the United States, who led the PLoS study.

""Now we have the outline of a map that tells us where we can look for common treatments.""

Most people who develop MS experience their first symptoms in their 20s and 30s, but Compston and colleagues told a briefing in London the trigger for the disease could happen in early childhood when genetic risk factors coincide with some as yet unknown environmental factor.

For their study, Compston and Peter Donnelly of Oxford University worked with some 250 other researchers and studied the DNA from 9,772 people with multiple sclerosis and compared it with a control group of more than 17,300 healthy people.

Their analysis confirmed 23 previously known genetic links and identified another 29 new genetic variants.

Experts think both genetic and environmental factors are equally important in determining who is likely to develop MS, and taken together, the known genetic variants probably explain about 20 percent of the genetic links, they said.

Previous research has suggested a link between Vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of MS. Compston's team said that along with the many genes which play a role in the immune system, they had also found two involved in the metabolism of Vitamin D -- which mostly comes from sunlight -- lending weight to a possible link between genes and the environment.","{""Nature"": 1, ""PLoS Genetics"": 1, ""PLoS"": 1}","{""Biogen"": 1, ""Alastair Compston"": 1, ""Chris Cotsapas"": 1, ""Compston"": 2, ""Peter Donnelly"": 1}","{""Tysabri"": 1, ""Biogen and Elan, Lemtrada"": 1, ""Campath"": 1, ""Sanofi"": 1, ""Genzyme"": 1, ""Abbott"": 1, ""Cambridge University"": 1, ""the Public Library of Science"": 1, ""PLoS Genetics"": 1, ""Yale University"": 1, ""PLoS"": 1, ""Oxford University"": 1, ""Compston"": 1}","{""Alastair Compston"": 1, ""Compston"": 3, ""Chris Cotsapas"": 1, ""Peter Donnelly"": 1}","{""Tysabri"": 1, ""Biogen and Elan, Lemtrada"": 1, ""Campath"": 1, ""Sanofi"": 1, ""Genzyme"": 1, ""Abbott"": 1, ""Cambridge University"": 1, ""Compston"": 4, ""the Public Library of Science"": 1, ""PLoS Genetics"": 1, ""PLoS"": 2, ""Yale University"": 1, ""Oxford University"": 1}"

The chemical agent L-BET151 acts on the protein and DNA ""packaging"" in cells called chromatin.

Cambridge scientists have shown that the drug appears to block a key stage in the development of mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL), both in mice and in cancer cells grown in a laboratory.

Human trials may start within a year.

MLL begins when two genes fuse to form a rogue gene, which produces an abnormal protein.

This switches on other genes that cause cells to grow out of control.

The new drug, known as I-BET151, was developed to stop the fusion protein communicating with other genes.",,{},"{""MLL"": 1}",,"{""MLL"": 1}"
03-11-032_reuters,2011-10-02,Study finds early potential in GlaxoSmithKline leukaemia drug,"British scientists conducting early-stage research have found that a potential new drug from GlaxoSmithKline could treat mixed-lineage leukaemia(MLL) -- the most common form of leukaemia in babies.

In a study published in the journal Nature, scientists from the British drugmaker collaborating with the charity Cancer Research UK (CRUK) and Cellzome AG found that the experimental drug, called I-BET151, mimics a chemical tag which is key to preventing the process of activating the leukaemia genes.

""This ... is an exciting new avenue for drug discovery which we hope will be useful for other types of cancer in addition to MLL-leukaemia's,"" said Tony Kouzarides of the Wellcome Trust/CRUK Gurdon Institute at Cambridge University, who co-led the study.

Kevin Lee, head of epigenetics discovery research at GSK, who also worked on the study, said he too was excited about the findings, although it will probably be many years before the drug could potentially reach the market.

""Even though this is still lab-based ... it validates the idea of developing small molecules against epigenetic switches,"" he said in an emailed comment.

""It is important to remember we will need to be successful on a number of additional steps before we can move this from the lab to testing this compound in humans.""

MLL leukaemia is thought to account for up to 80 percent of cases of acute leukaemia in children below two years old, and up to one in 10 cases in adults.

Most patients don't respond well to standard leukaemia treatments and often the cancer comes back.

The disease is caused when a gene called MLL gets fused to another gene.

This disrupts the normal function of MLL by creating a new ""fusion protein"" that behaves wrongly, switching on genes that drive the development of leukaemia.

Kouzarides's team found that in the disease, the MLL-fusion proteins are targeted to leukaemia-causing genes by proteins from the BET family, which recognise certain chemical ""tags"" on chromatin, the scaffold on which DNA is arranged.

Using I-BET151 to treat leukaemias in mice and human cancer cells in a lab, the researchers found that the chemical could halt the disease, paving the way for more research to be done in first-stage, or so-called Phase I, human trials.

""We urgently need better ways to treat children with more aggressive forms of leukaemia, such as MLL,"" said Lesley Walker, CRUK's director of information.

""Although this research is only in the lab at the moment, we hope it will move quickly towards clinical trials in patients.""

Leukaemia is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in children and accounts for a around a third of all cancers diagnosed in children.

According to Cancer Research UK, eight out of 10 children with leukaemia in Britain now survive for five years or more, compared with one in 10 in the late 1960s.","{""Nature"": 1}","{""Tony Kouzarides"": 1, ""Kevin Lee"": 1, ""Kouzarides"": 1, ""Lesley Walker"": 1}","{""GlaxoSmithKline"": 1, ""Cancer Research UK"": 2, ""CRUK"": 2, ""Cellzome AG"": 1, ""the Wellcome Trust/CRUK Gurdon Institute"": 1, ""Cambridge University"": 1, ""GSK"": 1}","{""Tony Kouzarides"": 1, ""Kouzarides"": 2, ""Kevin Lee"": 1, ""Lesley Walker"": 1}","{""GlaxoSmithKline"": 1, ""Cancer Research UK"": 2, ""CRUK"": 2, ""Cellzome AG"": 1, ""the Wellcome Trust/CRUK Gurdon Institute"": 1, ""Cambridge University"": 1, ""GSK"": 1}"
14-11-027_bbcnews,2011-12-08,Bowel cancer screening 'does cut deaths',"A bowel cancer screening programme in England is on course to cut deaths by a sixth, say researchers studying results from the first million people tested.

However, the work, published in the journal Gut, has raised concerns that the programme, launched in 2006, misses tumours in certain parts of the colon.

Testers checked a faeces sample for signs of abnormal bleeding.

The researcher who analysed the results said money should be spent on bringing in more sensitive tests.

Approximately 16,000 people a year die from bowel cancer, making it second only to lung cancer as a cause of death in the UK.

Part of the reason for the high mortality rate is that symptoms often do not appear until cancer is advanced and harder to treat.

The screening programme aims to catch the tumours earlier, meaning more patients can be cured.

Several million people aged 60 and over have now been screened, with approximately half of those invited taking part. 

When results from the first 1.08 million taking part were collated, it was found that 2.5% of men and 1.5% of women had received an abnormal result, and were sent for further tests, usually colonoscopy, in which a tube with a camera on the end is passed into the colon.

Early stage cancers 

Among the men with abnormal results, 43% turned out to have either cancer or pre-cancerous growths in their colon.

The figure for women was 11.6%.

Most of these were early-stage cancers, which are generally easier to treat.

Professor Julietta Patnick, director of the NHS Cancer Screening Programmes, said she was ""delighted"" by the results.

""We are pleased to be on track to cut bowel cancer deaths by our target of 16% - early detection is crucial to lowering the number deaths from bowel cancer.""

However, the test appeared to be less effective at spotting cancers in the upper section, or ""right side"" of the colon.

Cancer statistics from millions of people diagnosed with the disease suggest that for every three cancers in the left side of the colon, there will be one in the right side.

However, of the thousands of cancers found by the screening test, only 14% were on the right side.

Questions remain 

Prof Richard Logan, of Nottingham University, who led the study, said it was not yet fully understood why cancers on the right-hand side were not showing up during screening.

Among the possibilities, he said, were that they grew faster, and were more likely to be diagnosed conventionally, or that they were less likely to bleed and trigger a positive test result.

However, he said that the current blood test was ""old fashioned"", and should be replaced by a more modern alternative which might be more sensitive.

He said: ""There is a much better test available, but it will cost money to introduce it, and that money is not currently there.""

A spokesman for the screening programme said that the move to the new test was being ""actively considered"", although no date had been set for a change.

Deborah Alsina, the chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK, welcomed the results, adding that separate moves to widen access to a form of colonoscopy called flexible sigmoidoscopy would also improve screening.

""As a higher proportion of cancers are being found in the left side of the bowel than predicted, the rollout of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening in the new year will help to save even more lives. 

""However, this does need to be rolled out quickly with a sustained focus on areas with low uptake of screening.""","{""Gut"": 1}","{""Julietta Patnick"": 1, ""Richard Logan"": 1, ""Deborah Alsina"": 1}","{""the NHS Cancer Screening Programmes"": 1, ""Nottingham University"": 1, ""Bowel Cancer UK"": 1}","{""Richard Logan"": 1}","{""the NHS Cancer Screening Programmes"": 1, ""Nottingham University"": 1, ""Bowel Cancer UK"": 1}"
13-11-010_dailymail,2011-06-24,COULD A 2-MONTH LOW-CALORIE DIET DEFEAT DIABETES?,"The form of diabetes that blights the lives of millions of middle-aged Britons could be wiped out by cutting calories severely for just two months, research suggests.

After a small-scale trial, diabetics who consumed just 600 calories a day Ð the amount many people would eat at lunch alone Ð were able to throw away their tablets.

Eighteen months on, some are still free of type 2 diabetes, which is linked to obesity and usually occurs in middle age.

The Newcastle University researchers described the result as remarkable and said it proves that the condition that affects 2.5million Britons need not be a life sentence.

It also paves the way for new treatments for those who cannot stick to the drastic diet.

Professor Roy Taylor, the study's lead author, said: 'This is a radical change in our understanding of type 2 diabetes.

'While it has long been believed that the disease will steadily get worse, we have shown that we can reverse it.'

In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas does not make enough insulin Ð a hormone key in the conversion of sugar into energy Ð and the insulin that is made does not work properly.

The condition is often controlled initially with a stringent diet and exercise regime. 

But many sufferers see their health worsen and eventually need tablets or insulin injections.

Diabetics are more likely to develop heart disease, blindness, kidney disease and nerve and circulatory damage, which at its worst can lead to amputations.

Reversing the condition could therefore improve long-term health and quality of life.

The researchers put 11 men and women with type 2 diabetes on a diet of 600 calories a day for eight weeks.

After just a week, some of their blood sugar readings had returned to normal, the journal Diabetologia reports.

After two months, fat levels in the pancreas had returned to normal and the organ was able to pump out insulin without any problems. 

Some patients no longer needed tablets to control high blood pressure.

The researchers believe that a strict diet melts away fat clogging up the pancreas, allowing it to operate normally.

Three months after the end of the diet, seven of the 11 men and women were still diabetes-free. 

Now, 18 months on, four of the five that have been in touch with the researchers still have no signs of diabetes.

Dr Iain Frame, of Diabetes UK, which funded the study, warned that no one should go on such a drastic diet without speaking to his or her doctor.

CURSE OF THE MIDDLE-AGED

IN diabetes, the amount of sugar in the blood is too high because the body lacks the insulin to use it properly.

Most of the 2.8million Britons with diabetes have the type 2 form in which the pancreas does not make not enough insulin.

While it is not known why the pancreas stops working properly, the latest research suggests that a coating of fat is at least partly to blame.

It is linked to obesity and usually occurs in middle age, although it is seen increasingly in children and teenagers as waistlines balloon.

In contrast, type 1 diabetes usually develops in childhood or adolescence and is caused by the body's immune system turning on the pancreas and destroying the insulin-producing cells.

People with this form of the condition cannot make any insulin at all and need to inject the hormone regularly.

Simply becoming slimmer would not repair the damage.","{""Diabetologia"": 1}","{""Roy Taylor"": 1, ""Iain Frame"": 1}","{""Newcastle University"": 1, ""Diabetologia"": 1, ""Diabetes UK"": 1}","{""Roy Taylor"": 1}","{""Newcastle University"": 1, ""Diabetologia"": 1, ""Diabetes UK"": 1}"

Trials at Newcastle University put 11 patients on a diet of liquid drinks, vitamins, minerals and vegetables.

After one week blood sugar levels were normal and three months later, after going back to usual eating, seven patients were still cured.

 Trial member Gordon Parmley, 67, said: ""I love playing golf but I was finding that when I was out on the course sometimes my vision would go fuzzy and I would have trouble focussing.

""It was after this that I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes.

 That was about six years ago and from then on, I had to control the diabetes with a daily combination of tablets.

13-11-010_express,2011-06-24,WONDER CURE FOR DIABETES,"Breakthrough is remarkable says professor

EATING an ultra low-calorie diet can cure Type 2 diabetes in just eight weeks, dramatic new research has shown.

Even people who have suffered from the condition for years found the drastic diet could jump-start their body's production of insulin.

The breakthrough is good news for the nearly 2.5million people in Britain who have this type of diabetes, which is caused by the pancreas not producing enough insulin to break down glucose in the blood.

It could revolutionise the treatment of what has always been seen as a lifelong problem.

Professor Roy Taylor, of Newcastle University, who led the research, said: ""To have people free of diabetes after years with the condition is remarkable - and all because of an eight-week diet. 

For many years it has been assumed that Type 2 diabetes is a life sentence.

 It's chronic, it's progressive, people need more and more tablets, and eventually they need insulin. It's a downhill slope.

 However, we have been able to show that it is in fact reversible.

""We have been able to put diabetes into reverse by a very low-calorie diet over a short period of time.

""What is really important and very new is the changes in the body that go along with this. 

Specifically, the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas have gone to sleep in Type 2 diabetes, they are not really doing very much.

""As the level of fat in the pancreas has reduced, we have seen these insulin-producing cells come competely back to normal, and that is truly remarkable.""

He added: ""This represents a radical change in our understanding of the condition. 

Insulin cells, if they are exposed to fat, don't work.

 If they are protected from the fat they perform normally. It is quite possible that we may be able to devise medicines that block the effect of fat and allow normal function.""

He warned patients, however, not to try the new wonder cure without close medical supervision.

Patients in the clinical trial had their food intake cut to just 600 calories a day for two months.

Professor Taylor said: ""People ought to think about cutting down what they eat by perhaps a half. 

On average, someone with a Body Mass Index of 30 will get diabetes. 

If they got down to a BMI of 19-25, which is the healthy range, it would dramatically improve or even reverse their diabetes.

""A diet of 1,200 to 1,500 calories a day would achieve weight loss in most people.""

Dr Iain Frame, director of research at Diabetes UK, also urged caution.

""We welcome the results of this research because it shows that Type 2 diabetes can be reversed, on a par with successful surgery without the side effects, "" he said.

""However, this diet is not an easy fix and Diabetes UK strongly recommends that such a drastic diet should only be undertaken under medical supervision.""

Type 2 diabetes, which can cause strokes, heart attacks and blindness, normally develops during middle age as a result of obesity or an unhealthy lifestyle. 

The Type 1 version is genetic.

In the trial, 11 patients ate a ""meal replacement"" milkshake of 150 calories three times a day.

This was supplemented with three portions of non-starchy vegetables including cabbage, broccoli, peppers, tomatoes, cucumber and lettuce.

After just one week, their pre-breakfast blood sugar levels had returned to normal and an MRI scan revealed that the fat levels in the pancreas were also normal, down from around eight per cent to six per cent.

The pancreas also regained the normal ability to make insulin and as a result, blood sugar levels after meals steadily improved.

The volunteers returned to eating normally but received advice on portion size and healthy eating. Three months later, seven remained free of diabetes.

The research, published in the journal Diabetologia, suggests a dramatic drop in calories has a direct effect on reducing fat accumulated in the pancreas, which in turn prompts insulin cells to ""wake up"".

The findings are consistent with the belief that a lack of insulin secretion, which is vital for blood sugar control, is due to accumulation of fat in the liver and pancreas.

It has long been known that people who restrict their calorie intake and remain slim live longer than those who eat freely.

A low-calorie diet is also thought to slash the risk of developing cancer, heart disease and stroke, while staving off age-related degeneration of the brain and nervous system.","{""Diabetologia"": 1}","{""Roy Taylor"": 1, ""Taylor"": 1, ""Iain Frame"": 1}","{""Newcastle University"": 1, ""Diabetes UK"": 1}","{""Roy Taylor"": 1, ""Taylor"": 2}","{""Newcastle University"": 1, ""Diabetes UK"": 1}"

13-11-010_guardian,2011-06-24,Front: Low-calorie diet offers hope of cure for type 2 diabetes: British study overturns assumptions about 'lifelong' condition,"People who have had obesity-related type 2 diabetes for years have been cured, at least temporarily, by keeping to an extreme, low-calorie, diet for two months, scientists report today.

The discovery, reported by scientists at Newcastle University, overturns previous assumptions about type 2 diabetes, which was thought to be a lifelong illness.

In the UK about two and a half million people have been diagnosed with diabetes, the large majority with type 2, and numbers are rising across much of the world. 

The condition has to be controlled with drugs and eventually insulin injections. It can cause blindness and end in foot amputation, as well as shortening life.

The results of the Newcastle investigation, though the study was small, demonstrated that full recovery was possible, not through drugs but through diet.

Eleven people with diabetes took part in the study, which was funded by Diabetes UK. They had to slash their food intake to just 600 calories a day for two months. 

But three months later seven of the 11 were free of diabetes.

""To have people free of diabetes after years with the condition is remarkable - and all because of an eight-week diet,"" said Roy Taylor, professor at Newcastle University, who led the study.

 ""This is a radical change in understanding type 2 diabetes. It will change how we can explain it to people newly diagnosed with the condition. 

While it has long been believed that someone with type 2 diabetes will always have the disease, and that it will steadily get worse, we have shown that we can reverse the condition.""

Type 2 diabetes, which used to be known as adult onset, is caused by too much glucose in the blood. 

It is strongly linked to obesity, unlike type 1, which usually develops in children whose bodies are unable to make the hormone insulin to convert glucose from food into energy. 

They need daily insulin injections.

The research, presented today at the American Diabetes Association conference, shows that an extremely low-calorie diet, consisting of diet drinks and non-starchy vegetables, prompts the body to remove the fat clogging the pancreas and preventing it from making insulin.

The volunteers were closely supervised by a medical team and matched with the same number of volunteers with diabetes who did not get the special diet. 

After just one week into the study, the pre-breakfast blood sugar levels of the study group had returned to normal. 

And MRI scans showed that the fat levels in the pancreas had returned to normal. 

The pancreas regained its ability to make insulin.

After the eight-week diet the volunteers returned to normal eating but had advice on healthy foods and portion size.

 Ten of the group were retested and seven had stayed free of diabetes.

Taylor, the director of the Newcastle Magnetic Resonance Centre, had the idea for the study after it was shown that diabetes was reversed in people who had undergone stomach stapling or other forms of bariatric surgery because of obesity. 

""What was remarkable was that the diabetes went away over the course of one week. 

It was widely believed the operation itself had done something, (that) the hormones in the gut were thought to be the cause.

 That is almost universally believed.""

Taylor thought the massive drop in calorie intake after surgery could be responsible and to test this hypothesis set up the study, which included MRI scans of the pancreas to look at any changes in the fatty deposits.

""We believe this shows that type 2 diabetes is all about energy balance in the body,"" said Taylor. 

""If you are eating more than you burn, then the excess is stored in the liver and pancreas as fat, which can lead to type 2 diabetes in some people. 

What we need to examine further is why some people are more susceptible to developing diabetes than others.""

He warned that only a minority of people, perhaps 5% or 10%, would be able to stick to the harsh diet necessary to get rid of diabetes.

 But even that, he said, would dramatically improve the health of many people and save the NHS millions.

Iain Frame, director of research at Diabetes UK, said people should not embark on such a diet without a doctor's approval and help.

 ""We welcome the results of this research because it shows that type 2 diabetes can be reversed, on a par with successful surgery without the side effects.



""However, this diet is not an easy fix and Diabetes UK strongly recommends that such a drastic diet should only be undertaken under medical supervision. 

Despite (it) being a very small trial, we look forward to future results, particularly to see whether the reversal remains long term.""

Gordon Parmley, 67, of Stocksfield, Newcastle upon Tyne, a trial participant, said he first noticed something was wrong when his vision went ""fuzzy"" and he had trouble focusing while playing golf.

 He had been on medication since being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes six years ago.

He said: ""I thought I'd give (the trial) a go, as it might help me and other diabetics.

 I came off my tablets and had three diet shakes a day and some salad or vegetables, but it was very, very, difficult and I'm not sure I'd have done it without the support of my wife, who went on a diet alongside me.

13-11-010_telegraph,2011-06-24,The 'cure' for Type 2 diabetes: a crash diet of 600 calories a day,"TYPE 2 diabetes can be reversed in as little as seven days by going on a crash diet, according to a scientist.

Adhering to a strict 600 calories a day causes fat levels in the pancreas to drop rapidly, restoring normal function, Prof Roy Taylor of Newcastle University found.

The discovery holds out the possibility that the 2.5million people with the condition in Britain could cure themselves, if they had the willpower.

Until recently, received medical wisdom was that Type 2 diabetes - the most common form of the disorder which usually develops later in life - was largely irreversible. 

But the new small-scale study indicated that defeating it could be easier than commonly thought.

Prof Taylor asked 11 volunteers, all recently diagnosed, to go on what he admitted was an ""extreme diet"" of specially formulated drinks and non-starchy vegetables, for eight weeks.

After just a week, pre-breakfast blood sugar levels had returned to normal, suggesting a resumption of correct pancreas and liver function.

After eight weeks, all had managed to reverse their diabetes. Three months on, seven remained free of it.

Prof Taylor explained that too much fat ""clogged up"" the operation of the pancreas at a cellular level, preventing normal secretion of insulin which regulates blood sugar. 

When this fat was removed - by way of the diet - normal function resumed.

He said: ""This is a radical change in understanding Type 2 diabetes. 

It will change how we can explain it to people newly diagnosed with the condition.



""While it has long been believed that someone with Type 2 diabetes will always have the disease, and that it will steadily get worse, we have shown that we can reverse the condition.""

Gordon Parmley, 67, from Stocksfield in Northumberland, one of the volunteers, said: ""At the end of the trial, I was told my insulin levels were normal and after six years, I no longer needed my diabetes tablets.

Still today, 18 months on, I don't take them. 

It's astonishing really that a diet - hard as it was - could change my health so drastically.""

The idea of the crash diet came from the observation that gastric bypass patients were often quickly relieved of Type 2 diabetics. 

Many thought this was because surgery affected gut hormones which had a knock-on effect on the pancreas.

But Prof Taylor thought it might be because the surgery severely constrained what patients could eat. He set up the diet experiment to test his hypothesis.

He said special MRI scans showed the proportion of fat in volunteers' pancreases dropped during the eight weeks, from eight to six per cent.

 ""This study does not just show proof of principal, it shows proof of mechanism,"" he added.

He is presenting the findings to the American Diabetes Association conference in San Diego this weekend.

Dr Iain Frame, director of research at Diabetes UK, which supported the study, said: ""It shows that Type 2 diabetes can be reversed, on a par with successful surgery without the side effects. However, this diet is not an easy fix.""

Prof Taylor estimated that as few as five per cent of patients would be able to stick to the diet.

The breakthrough, made by experts at Newcastle University, suggests that a dramatic drop in calories reduces fat in the pancreas and is yet more evidence that fat is a primary cause of the disease.

The findings are consistent with the belief that a lack of insulin secretion - which is vital for blood sugar control - is due to accumulation of fat in the liver and pancreas.

Roy Taylor, of Newcastle University, said: ""For many years, it has been assumed that Type 2 diabetes is a life sentence. 

It's chronic, it's progressive, people need more and more tablets, and eventually they need insulin. 

It's a downhill slope. However, we have been able to show that it is in fact reversible.""

Professor Taylor, who hopes the research will be translated into future treatments, added: ""This is a radical change in understanding Type 2 diabetes.""

Some 2.5 million people in the UK are diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and another 850,000 are thought to have the condition without knowing it.

Dr Iain Frame, director of research at Diabetes UK, said: ""We welcome the results of this research because it shows that Type 2 diabetes can be reversed, on a par with successful surgery without the side effects. 

However, this diet is not an easy fix and Diabetes UK strongly recommends that such a drastic diet should only be undertaken under medical supervision.""

Keith Frayn, professor of human metabolism at the University of Oxford, said: ""Professor Taylor's study offers great hope for many people with diabetes, although it must be said that not everyone will find it possible to stick to the extremely low calorie diet used in this study.""",,"{""Roy Taylor"": 1, ""Taylor"": 2, ""Iain Frame"": 1, ""Keith Frayn"": 1}","{""Newcastle University"": 2, ""Diabetes UK"": 1, ""the University of Oxford"": 1}","{""Roy Taylor"": 1, ""Taylor"": 1}","{""Newcastle University"": 2, ""Diabetes UK"": 1, ""the University of Oxford"": 1}"

Eating just 600 calories a day could be all it takes to kick-start the insulin cells, 'a remarkable' study has shown.

Experts testing their theory on a group of Type 2 diabetics found the blood sugar levels of every volunteer had returned to normal just seven days into an eightweek diet.

 Over two months, insulin cell function in the pancreas improved and pancreatic fat decreased.

Three months later, after going back to normal eating, seven people out of the 11 remained free of Type 2 diabetes.

Study leader Prof Roy Taylor of Newcastle University said: 'For many years, it has been assumed that Type 2 diabetes is a life sentence.

Now researchers at the University of Cambridge have found that siblings of those with autism show similar brain patterns when viewing facial expressions.

The findings could help scientists identify a 'biomarker', used to identify genes linked to an increased familial risk of autism.

Dr Michael Spencer, who led the study, said: 'The findings provide a springboard to investigate what specific genes are associated with this biomarker.

'The brain's response to facial emotion could be a fundamental building block in causing autism and its associated difficulties.'

The study, published in the journal Translational Psychiatry, compared 40 families that had both a teenager with autism and a sibling without, with 40 teenagers with no family history of autism.

By comparing the brain's activity when viewing a happy versus a neutral face, the scientists were able to observe the areas within the brain that respond to this emotion.

Although siblings of those with autism did not have autism or Asperger syndrome, they had decreased activity in some areas of the brain.

Explaining why only one of the siblings might develop autism when both have the same biomarker, Dr Spencer said: 'It is likely that in the sibling who develops autism, additional as yet unknown steps - such as further genetic, brain structure or function differences - take place to cause autism.'

Statins could boost the immune system and lower the risk of infection, new research has found.

Scientists from the University of Edinburgh have found that the body naturally lowers cholesterol levels during an infection because viruses like to ""feed"" off it.

Limiting its production by using statins therefore curbs the invader's ability to thrive.

Professor Peter Ghazal, who led the study, said: ""A key immune hormone stimulated upon infection can lower cholesterol levels and thereby deprive viral infections of the sustenance they need to grow.

""Drugs currently exist to lower cholesterol levels, but the next step would be to see if such drugs would also work to help bolster our immune systems.""

While he said statins could work to boost the immune system, smart drugs could potentially be created which worked in a much more targeted way.

Such drugs could provide alternatives to antibiotics, he said.

They would avoid the problem of bacteria developing antibiotic resistance, because they would work on the way the body itself responded to infection, rather than attacking the bacteria.

>>2 Lower cholesterol could help fight viruses","Cutting cholesterol could help the body's immune system fight viral infections, researchers in Scotland have suggested.

The scientists, from the University of Edinburgh, said they had found a ""direct link"" between the workings of the immune system and cholesterol levels in the body.

Their research, published in the journal PLoS Biology, found that when the body succumbs to a viral infection a hormone in the immune system sends signals to blood cells, causing cholesterol levels to fall.

Cholesterol produced by the body is needed by viruses and certain types of bacteria to maintain growth.

Limiting the body's production of cholesterol would help curb the opportunity for the viruses to thrive by cutting off this source of energy.

The researchers said the findings could lead to new ways of treating viral infections, targeting the actions of cholesterol in the body.

Currently drugs such as antibiotics are used to fight infections by targeting the bug directly.

But a new treatment would help overcome the problems associated with antibiotic resistance, as it enhances the way the body responds to an infection, instead of focusing on attacking the infection itself.

Cholesterol is a fatty substance which is found in the blood and is mainly made in the body.

The substance plays an essential role in how cells in the body work, but too much cholesterol in the blood can increase the risk of heart problems.

A common cause of high blood cholesterol levels is eating too much saturated fat and people are often advised to change their diet to reduce their risk of heart problems.

Doctors also frequently prescribe drugs known as statins which help lower cholesterol and cut people's risks.

Statins are one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in Scotland.

It now seems that reducing cholesterol levels could have an extra benefit in helping the body to fight infections.

Professor Peter Ghazal, of the university's Division of Pathway Medicine, said cutting off the supply of cholesterol needed by viruses could help in the battle against infections.

""What we have discovered is that a key immune hormone stimulated upon infection can lower cholesterol levels and thereby deprive viral infections of the sustenance they need to grow,"" the researcher said.

""Drugs currently exist to lower cholesterol levels, but the next step would be to see if such drugs would also work to help bolster our immune systems.""

05-11-007_reuters,2011-03-08,Curbing cholesterol may fight infections: study,"Lowering cholesterol levels could help the body's immune system fight infections, British scientists said on Tuesday.

A study in mice by researchers at the University of Edinburgh found a direct link between the workings of the immune system and cholesterol levels.

""What we have discovered is that a key immune hormone stimulated upon infection can lower cholesterol levels and thereby deprive viral infections of the sustenance they need to grow,"" said Edinburgh's Peter Ghazal, whose study was published in the Public Library of Science (PLoS) Biology journal.

""Drugs currently exist to lower cholesterol levels, but the next step would be to see if such drugs would also work to help bolster our immune systems,"" he said.

Medicines called statins, such as Pfizer's Lipitor, AstraZeneca's Crestor, and a generic called simvastatin, are widely prescribed to lower ""bad"" or LDL cholesterol -- a risk factor for heart disease -- and are credited with being among the most successful drugs in helping to prevent heart attacks and strokes.

In a telephone interview, Ghazal said many years of research work lay ahead before these findings could be translated into human treatments, but he thought statin-like drugs could in future be developed to have potent anti-infective effects as well as being able to reduce levels of bad cholesterol.

Currently, antiviral drugs are used to fight viral infections by targeting the machinery that enables viruses to multiply.

Antibiotics are used to fight bacterial infections, but bugs are able to mutate and develop new strains that are drug-resistant, prompting the need for new and more powerful medicines to be developed all the time.

Ghazal said his research team hoped to use the studies to find news ways of combating infections, which could for example involve mimicking immune signals sent out to lower the production of cholesterol.

Such treatments would help overcome the problems of drug resistance, Ghazal said, since they would aim to enhance the way the body responds to an infection, instead of focusing on attacking the bug itself.

07-11-030_dailymail,2011-09-01,It really is in the genes! Skinny people have an 'overdose' of chromosomes that keep them thin,"Those annoying people who claim that they can eat what they like but never put on weight may have had a second helping of a newly discovered 'skinny gene'. 

While many genes have been identified as leading to obesity, this is the first time a genetic explanation for 'extreme thinness' has been unveiled. 

According to a study published in the journal Nature, the genes in question are a group of 28 that form part of chromosome 16.

Last year the same research team found that people without these genes are 43 times more likely to be morbidly obese. 

However, it has now been revealed that people in whom these particular genes are duplicated are more likely to be skinny. 

It mean that fatness and thinness could be two sides of the same coin.

Researchers at Imperial College London and the University of Lausanne in Switzerland said around one in 2,000 people have the duplicated genes, making men 23 times more likely to be underweight, and women five times more likely. 

Normally, each person has a copy of each chromosome from each parent, giving them two copies of each gene. 

But sometimes sections of a chromosome can be duplicated or deleted, resulting in an abnormal 'dosage' of genes, the researchers explained in their study. 

'This is the first genetic cause of extreme thinness that has been identified,' said Professor Philippe Froguel from Imperial's school of public health, who led the study. 

'It's also the first example of a deletion and a duplication of one part of the genome having opposite effects.'          

The discovery has important implications for diagnosis in children's health.

A non-specific condition in children known as 'failure to thrive' - where their rate of weight gain is significantly lower than normal - has been diagnosed in half of all children with the genetic duplication, the study showed. 

It means 'failure to thrive' can be genetically driven. 

'If a child is not eating, it's not necessarily the parents' fault,' said Prof Froguel.       

He added that scientists still have much work to do to find out more about the genes in this region, but their discovery could eventually lead to new potential treatments for obesity and appetite disorders.    

'If we can work out why gene duplication in this region causes thinness, it might throw up new potential treatments for obesity and appetite disorders,' he said.

'We now plan to sequence these genes and find out what they do, so we can get an idea of which ones are involved in regulating appetite.               

Froguel's team examined the DNA of more than 95,000 people for their study for which being underweight was defined as having a body mass index (BMI) below 18.5 kg per metre squared.          

The research also showed a quarter of people with the duplication had microcephaly, a condition in which the head and brain are abnormally small and which is linked to neurological defects and shorter life expectancy.

Genes are stretches of DNA that provide the coded instructions for making proteins.

They generally come in pairs and are housed in the chromosomes, the packaged bundles of DNA inherited from each parent.

However sometimes parts of either chromosome in a pair can be deleted or duplicated. 

When this happens, there can be too many copies of a certain gene or too few.

As a result, a gene might be abnormally active or not active enough.

As regards the 'skinny gene', Prof Froguel said: 'The dogma is that we have two copies of each gene, but this isn't really true.

'The genome is full of holes where genes are lost, and in other places we have extra copies of genes. 

In many cases, duplications and deletions have no effect, but occasionally they can lead to disease.

'So far, we have discovered a large number of genetic changes that lead to obesity. 

'It seems that we have plenty of systems that increase appetite since eating is so important - you can suppress one and nothing happens. 

'This is the first genetic cause of extreme thinness that has been identified.'

The vaccine is designed to trigger production of a range of antibodies to fight different types of parasite causing the disease. 

An Edinburgh University study combined multiple versions of a protein found in many types of malaria parasite.

The key protein is known to trigger production of antibodies on infection.

The researchers who developed the vaccine said that because malaria parasites exist in many forms, the only way to gain natural immunity against all strains is by having multiple bouts of the illness.

A vaccine which overcomes this could be especially useful in children and other vulnerable groups of people.

Human trials 

Many previous vaccines against malaria have had limited success because they target only a limited part of the parasite population.

The new vaccine has also shown to be effective in animals. 

Tests in blood samples from children in endemic areas showed that the antibodies against this key protein offered improved protection against the disease.

Scientists now hope to carry out full-scale human trials.

Malaria is spread by mosquito bites and affects people and animals, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa.

It found that mistakes were most likely with inhalers rather than tablets, capsules or liquid medicines.

Researchers say people who are not getting the right doses run the risk of developing a chest infection.

They're calling for staff at care homes to get better training in the use of inhalers.

The study looked at 233 residents in 55 care homes across England and monitored their doses of medicines over two drug rounds.

In addition researchers looked at data collected from another recent study on the same group of care home residents.

The results showed that the chance of a mistake was 30 times higher when staff had to administer an inhaler rather than help a resident take some tablets. 

There was also a greater chance of a mistake if the drugs were given in liquid form rather than tablets or capsules. 

 “Start Quote

Older people, wherever they live, must be able to expect regular reviews of their medication, which includes how it is being taken and what treatments are being used”

End Quote Michelle Mitchell Age UK 

Dr David Alldred of Leeds University School of Healthcare says care home staff need better training in the use of medical inhalers so that residents with breathing disorders get the treatment that they need.

""Medical inhalers are relatively complex devices and require a number of steps to be taken correctly in the right sequence. Even the simplest inhaler can be difficult to use correctly and this is particularly the case for older people. 

""Approximately one in 10 care home residents will have been prescribed an inhaler-based medicine for some sort of respiratory disorder. If that condition is not treated correctly, their breathlessness will not be relieved and they may be at higher risk of developing a chest infection.""

In a paper published in the journal BMJ Quality and Safety, the researchers say many inhaler mistakes happen because staff forget to shake the device, or staff give the wrong number of inhalations.

Residents sometimes also forget to hold their breath and so some of the medicine - in powdered form - escapes out of their mouths.

Poor understanding 

In the study tablets or capsules accounted for more than half of medicines given to residents, 1 in 9 drugs were in liquid form and just 4% were inhalers.

Michelle Mitchell, Age UK's Charity Director, said the research is another example of how older people in care homes are having bad experiences with their medication. 

""Many older people, particularly those living in a care home, rely on a daily regime of multiple medications to maintain a reasonable level of health and wellbeing. Where this includes less common treatments, like medicines in liquid form, it is no excuse for an increased risk of error. 

""There is already an often poor understanding of the effect of certain treatments on older people, particularly when someone is taking a number of different drugs. Older people, wherever they live, must be able to expect regular reviews of their medication, which includes how it is being taken and what treatments are being used.""

Nadra Ahmed, chairman of the National Care Association, said this is an important piece of research that would make people think carefully about the training of care staff.

""I would hazard a guess that most staff in the care sector would be aware about the administration of the correct drug dosage. But if better training safeguards vulnerable people we should ensure that it is part and parcel of a good training package.""","{""BMJ Quality and Safety"": 1}","{""Mitchell Age UK"": 1, ""David Alldred"": 1, ""Michelle Mitchell"": 1, ""Nadra Ahmed"": 1}","{""Leeds University"": 1, ""Leeds University School of Healthcare"": 1, ""BMJ Quality and Safety"": 1, ""the National Care Association"": 1}","{""Mitchell Age UK"": 1, ""David Alldred"": 1, ""Michelle Mitchell"": 1}","{""Leeds University"": 2, ""Leeds University School of Healthcare"": 1}"

Teams at Edinburgh University and University of California in San Diego found overconfidence beat accurate assessment in a wide variety of situations, including sport, business and even war. 

The study suggests 'self-delusion is a winning survival strategy' because those who believe that they can easily win conflicts often come out on top.

However, the study, published in the journal Nature, reveals that, when those people do get it wrong, the results can be catastrophic.

The authors cite the 2008 financial crash and the 2003 Iraq war as two examples of when extreme overconfidence backfired. Researchers used a mathematical model to simulate the effects of overconfidence over generations.

It pitted overconfident, accurate and under-confident strategies against each other in a variety of scenarios.

Overconfidence was found to frequently bring rewards, as long as the spoils were sufficiently large in relation to the costs of competing for them.

On the other hand, people with accurate perceptions usually fared worse. In short, the study found that those who expect to win usually do.

05-11-034_bbcnews,2011-11-21,Chicken virus study sheds light on human cancers,"A study into a virus commonly found in chickens could shed new light on how human cancers develop.

The study into Marek's disease could also benefit the poultry industry, making it possible to breed birds with greater resistance to the disease.

Edinburgh University scientists analysed thousands of genes to pinpoint those with a role in Marek's disease.

It is a viral infection that costs the global poultry industry more than £1.4bn a year.

The scientists at The Roslin Institute at Edinburgh University and the Institute for Animal Health identified a gene called IRG1 that makes chickens more susceptible to the disease.

The gene is thought to cause the death of cells, which can in turn lead to diseases including cancer.

Researchers also found how the Marek's disease virus may also encourage tumour growth.

Chickens and mammals, including humans, have anti-tumour mechanisms, one of which is controlled by a gene called HIC1. 

HIC1 switches on lots of other genes which have anti-tumour effects. 

The Marek's disease virus switches off the genes controlled by HIC1, meaning it turns off key genes that would normally work to block tumours. 

These genes are also linked to fighting tumours in humans and the study could help research into preventing some types of cancers in people, which like Marek's disease, are caused by viruses.

Such viruses include the human papilloma virus, which can lead to cervical cancer, and Kaposi's sarcoma, which affects patients with HIV.

Professor Pete Kaiser, of The Roslin Institute who led the research, said: ""Marek's disease is highly contagious and chickens are becoming increasingly resistant to vaccination. 

""Identifying a gene that increases the risk of Marek's disease could help us breed chickens that are less susceptible to infection.

Researchers analysed thousands of genes to pinpoint those that play a role in Marek's disease - a viral infection that costs the global poultry industry more than £1.4billion a year.

The scientists at the Roslin Institute at Edinburgh University and the Institute for Animal Health identified a gene called IRG1 that makes chickens more susceptible to the disease.

The gene is thought to cause the death of cells, which can in turn lead to diseases including cancer.

Researchers also found how the virus can also encourage tumour growth.

Chickens and mammals, including humans, have anti-tumour mechanisms, one of which is controlled by a gene called HIC1, which switches on other genes that have anti-tumour effects.

However, Marek's disease switches off the genes controlled by HIC1, leading to tumour growth.

Researchers at Edinburgh University's Roslin Institute said vCJD occurs when proteins known as prions accumulate in the spleen, lymph nodes and tonsils.

They then spread to the brain, causing a disease that can destroy nerve cells.

The study could lead to treatments to stop vCJD spreading to the brain.

The team said a study showed that blocking the production of a protein, PrPC, in one type of immune cell could stop the spread of prions.

Stopping these cells from expressing this protein did not affect the regular function of the immune system, they said.

The researchers found that when the follicular dendritic cells expressed PrPC, prions were able to replicate on the surface of these cells and spread throughout the body.

However, when the cells were prevented from producing PrPC, the prions were not able to multiply and were destroyed by other cells in the immune system.

Neil Mabbott, of the Roslin Institute, said: ""If we can find a way of stopping this protein from being expressed by specific immune cells then we could potentially block the spread of the disease to the brain.

""We also want to understand how cells are infected with vCJD in the first place, so that we can look at ways of stopping this from happening and find ways to diagnose the disease at its early stages.""

14-11-021_dailymail,2011-08-24,BREASTFED BABIES 'ARE NOT PROTECTED AGAINST ECZEMA',"BREASTFEEDING may not protect children against developing eczema, a study suggests.

Scientists found babies who were exclusively breastfed for four months or longer were just as likely to develop eczema as those weaned earlier. 

The UK is among European countries that recommends prolonged breastfeeding as a means of reducing the risk of childhood eczema.

Although the researchers are not disputing the other health benefits breastmilk offers, they say that there is only a 'small protective effect' against severe eczema among babies breastfed for less than four months in developed countries.

The experts, based at King's College London, The University of Nottingham and the University of Ulm, in Germany, looked at data from 51,119 children aged eight to 12, in 21 countries across Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia.

The study formed phase two of The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood, the largest research project of its type ever undertaken, in which information on eczema, breastfeeding and time of weaning was gathered by parental questionnaire.

Children also underwent a skin examination for eczema and skin prick testing to environmental allergens, including house dust mites, says the report published online in the British Journal of Dermatology.

The researchers found no evidence for a protective effect of breastfeeding and delayed weaning on eczema risk in both developed and developing countries.

Dr Carsten Flohr, one of the researchers based at King's College London, said: 'UK breastfeeding guidelines with regard to eczema should be reviewed.

'Further studies are required to explore how and when solids should be introduced alongside breastfeeding to aid protection against eczema and other allergic diseases.'

Dr Flohr added that the other benefits of breastfeeding on infant health, unrelated to eczema, remain important.

The Department of Health recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life with additional breastfeeding while the baby moves on to solids.

Nina Goad, of the British Association of Dermatologists, said: 'The size of this study means that its findings are very significant, although the authors recognise that further studies are needed.

13-11-002_mirror,2011-01-06,TEA CHEERS; GREEN LEAVES FIGHT DEMENTIA,"DRINKING green tea does you bags of good - it can help protect against Alzheimer's, dementia and cancer.

Regular fresh cuppas of the ancient Chinese brew are effective against the ""key triggers"" of disease, say scientists.

The tea's ingredients were also shown to have proven ""anti-cancer properties"" which slowed the growth of tumours, a team at Newcastle University has found.

Using a dummy digestive system they checked the tea's properties once absorbed by the body.

The aim was to identify compounds for use in medicines to fight the onset of dementia. 

It will affect more than one million people in Britain by 2020. Dr Ed Okello, who led the research, said: ""What was really exciting about this study was that when green tea is digested, the resulting chemicals are actually more effective against key triggers of Alzheimer's than undigested.

""We also found the digested compounds had anti-cancer properties, significantly slowing down the growth of the tumour cells used in our experiments.""

He said the key compounds in green tea had been used in Chinese herbal medicines for the past 5,000 years.

Regularly drinking green tea could protect the brain against forms of dementia including Alzheimer's, a study published today shows.

It could also play a vital role in protecting the body against cancer, the study in the journal Phytomedicine suggests.

Led by Ed Okello, the Newcastle University team wanted to know if the protective properties known to be present in the freshly brewed form are still active once the tea has been digested.

Dr Okello, from the university's School of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, said: ""What was really exciting about this study was that we found when green tea is digested by enzymes in the gut, the resulting chemicals are actually more effective against key triggers of Alzheimer's development than the undigested form of the tea.

""In addition to this, we also found the digested compounds had anti-cancer properties, significantly slowing down the growth of the tumour cells which we were using in our experiments.""

Digestion is a vital process which provides our bodies with the nutrients we need to survive. But nutrients are not necessarily absorbed into the body once food is digested.

""It's one of the reasons why we have to be so careful when we make claims about the health benefits of various foods and supplements,"" Okello said.

""There are certain chemicals we know to be beneficial and we can identify foods which are rich in them but what happens during the digestion process is crucial to whether these foods are actually doing us any good.""

As part of the research, the Newcastle team worked in collaboration with Dr Gordon McDougall of the Plant Products and Food Quality Group at the Scottish Crop Research Institute in Dundee, who developed technology which simulates the human digestive system.

Two compounds are known to play a significant role in the development of Alzheimer's disease: hydrogen peroxide and a protein known as beta-amyloid.

Previous studies have shown that compounds known as polyphenols, present in black and green tea, possess neuroprotective properties, binding with the toxic compounds and protecting the brain cells.

When ingested, the polyphenols are broken down to produce a mix of compounds and it was these the Newcastle team tested in their latest research.

Carrying out the experiments in the lab using a tumour cell model, they exposed the cells to varying concentrations of the different toxins and the digested green tea compounds.

Okello explained: ""The digested chemicals protected the cells, preventing the toxins from destroying the cells.

We also saw them affecting the cancer cells, significantly slowing down their growth.

""Green tea has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries and what we have here provides the scientific evidence why it may be effective against some of the key diseases we face today.""

The next step is to discover whether the beneficial compounds are produced during digestion after healthy human volunteers consume tea polyphenols.

Okello said: ""There are obviously many factors which together have an influence on diseases such as cancer and dementia – a good diet, plenty of exercise and a healthy lifestyle are all important.

Scientists have discovered flaws in people's DNA which may make them more likely to suffer from the condition.

Their findings could lead to the development of better treatments for the disorder, which is notoriously difficult to manage.

Researchers from King's College London working with an American team at Washington University Medical School in St Louis, have pinpointed a section of DNA they believe is responsible for depression.

This region Ð known as chromosome 3p25-26 Ð contains up to 40 genes, and one or more probably causes the condition.

British researchers first suggested genes could cause depression in 2003, but have so far been unable to pinpoint which genes are responsible.

They now plan to carry out more detailed work this year to identify the genes.

Up to one in five Britons will suffer from depression at some point during their lives. 

Although it is often triggered by traumatic events Ð such as grief, redundancy or divorce Ð scientists have long known certain people are more susceptible.

The scientists examined the DNA of more than 900 families with two or more siblings with depression.

Their findings, in the American Journal of Psychiatry, show that the depressed siblings had the same genetic variations in the same section of their DNA, suggesting depression is inherited from parents.

And in a rare occurrence in genetic research, a British-led international team's finding of a DNA region linked to depression has been replicated by another team from the United States who were studying an entirely separate group of people.

""What's remarkable is that both groups found exactly the same region in two separate studies,"" Pamela Madden, who led the U.S. team at Washington University, said in a statement.

The researchers said they hoped the findings would bring scientists closer to developing more effective treatments for patients with depression, since currently available medicines for depression only work in around half of patients.

""These findings ... will help us track down specific genes that are altered in people with this disease,"" said Gerome Breen of King's College London's Institute of Psychiatry, who led the other research group.

The researchers said they believed many genes were involved in depression.

These findings are unlikely to benefit patients immediately, with any new drugs developed from them likely to take another 10 to 15 years.

However, they will help scientists understand what may be happening at the genetic and molecular levels in people with depression.

The first study analysed more 800 families with recurrent depression, while the second examined depression and heavy smoking in a series of families from Australia and Finland.

Both studies were published in the American Journal of Psychiatry on Monday and both teams reported a strong link between depression and genetic variations in a region called chromosome 3p25-26.

""Normally in genetic studies of depression, replication of findings is very difficult and frequently takes years to emerge, if ever,"" said Breen, who gave a briefing in London about the work.

Major depression affects about 20 percent of people at some point in their lives. Severe and recurring depression affects up to 4 percent of people and is notoriously hard to treat.

The World Health Organisation has forecast that depression will rival heart disease as the health disorder with the highest disease burden in the world by 2020.

According to a 2006 study, depression is responsible for 100 million lost working days a year in England and Wales alone at a cost of 9 billion pounds.

Studies of families with depression have indicated that the disorder has a genetic link and scientists think around 40 percent of the risk of developing it is contributed by genes, with the rest down to environmental and other external factors.

18-11-013_dailymail,2011-12-09,BREAST SCREENING 'COULD DO MORE HARM THN GOOD',"BREAST cancer screening may cause more harm than good, according to a study.

It says women are more likely to be harmed and have unnecessary surgery in the first decade of being screened.

The study concludes the harms of screening, on average, largely offset the benefits in the first ten years.

After that, the benefits increase, but by much less than predicted when routine screening was introduced.

The study is significant because it re-examines data from the 1986 Forrest report that led to the introduction of NHS screening.

The report used a formula to estimate costs and benefits, but did not include potential harms.

It concluded screening would reduce deaths by one third, with few harms and low cost.

However, in the past decade there has been mounting evidence and controversy surrounding the true cost of screening to women in terms of ‘false positives’ and over-treatment of breast cancers that were never threatening.

This has included needless breast removal.

In the latest study, James Raftery, professor of health technology assessment at the University of Southampton, and his colleague Maria Chorozoglou, brought the Forrest report up to date with an analysis of the outcome for 100,000 women aged 50 and over surviving up to 20 years after first being screened.

They looked at harms such as false positives, where women get abnormal results that turn out to be normal, and over-treatment, which may include surgery on harmless cancers that would never have caused symptoms or death during a patient’s lifetime.

The research published on the medical journal website bmj.com found that once harms were included, the benefits in terms of lives saved were only half original estimates.

In the first few years of screening, women were, on average, more likely to be harmed.

The greatest benefit was for women aged 60 to 70, while older women may not live long enough to reap significant benefits.

Professor Raftery said: ‘At up to eight years, the harms generally outweigh the benefits, but at 20 years there are greater positive benefits.’

The vast majority of women undergoing surgery to remove a suspected tumour did not need the treatment.

‘There are lots of women who have had surgery who believe their lives were saved when in fact only around one in ten have had their life saved,’ said Professor Raftery.

He added: ‘There should be a fundamental overhaul of the screening programme - what’s the right time frame and how cost-effective is it?

‘We need trials to look at who is most likely to benefit from surgery and for measuring the levels and duration of the harms from surgery.’

A review of the NHS breast cancer screening programme has been announced by the national cancer director, Professor Sir Mike Richards.

Under the programme, which costs 696million a year in England, women are invited for three-yearly mammograms, or X-rays, between the ages of 50 and 70.

The age limits are being extended to 47-73.

Almost two million women are screened each year.

Researchers from the Nordic Cochrane Centre, who question the benefits of organised screening programmes, suggest the dramatic fall in breast cancer deaths in recent years is probably due to changes in risk factors and improved treatment.

They accused the heads of the NHS programme of sticking to beliefs from 25 years ago about the benefit of mammograms and supplying women with ‘astonishingly misleading’ statistics.

But Dr Caitlin Palframan of Breakthrough Breast Cancer said: ‘We believe breast screening is vital as it can detect breast cancer at the earliest possible stages.

The earlier breast cancer is picked up the better, as treatment options are more likely to be less aggressive and more successful.’

A spokesman for the Department of Health said it would look at the findings of the independent review, but added: ‘Our advice has not changed - we urge all women to go for breast screening when invited.

The best available evidence shows screening saves lives by detecting cancers earlier than they would otherwise have been.’","{""bmj.com"": 1}","{""James Raftery"": 1, ""Maria Chorozoglou"": 1, ""Forrest"": 1, ""Raftery"": 2, ""Mike Richards"": 1, ""Caitlin Palframan"": 1}","{""Forrest"": 1, ""NHS"": 3, ""the University of Southampton"": 1, ""the Nordic Cochrane Centre"": 1, ""Breakthrough Breast Cancer"": 1, ""the Department of Health"": 1}","{""James Raftery"": 1, ""Maria Chorozoglou"": 1, ""Forrest"": 1, ""Raftery"": 3, ""Mike Richards"": 1, ""Caitlin Palframan"": 1}","{""Forrest"": 2, ""NHS"": 2, ""the University of Southampton"": 1, ""the Nordic Cochrane Centre"": 1, ""Breakthrough Breast Cancer"": 1}"
18-11-013_guardian,2011-12-09,"Breast cancer screening does more harm than good, study claims","The controversy over the value of breast cancer screening has been reopened by a study which claims that it does women more harm than good.

Women may suffer negative consequences as a result of the screening programme such as unnecessary surgery to remove harmless cancers that posed them no risk, according to research published in the British Medical Journal.

The findings also highlight the possibility of women receiving ""false positives"", or results which are initially classed as abnormal but later turn out to be unproblematic.

The findings are the latest evidence to emerge which challenges the usefulness of breast cancer screening and warns that it can damage women.

Criticism of the screening programme has prompted the Department of Health (DH) to ask Professor Sir Mike Richards, the government's cancer tsar, to commission a review of the evidence alongside Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, from an independent panel of experts who have not previously researched breast screening.

That is intended to find consensus because ""we know that some scientists differ in their views towards screening"", a health department spokesman said.

The study, led by James Raftery, professor of health technology assessment at Southampton University, analysed data from the 1986 Forrest report, which led to screening being introduced in the UK.

The Forrest report said the value of screening could be measured by looking at quality adjusted life years (QALYs), which measure both the quality and quantity of extra life gained.

Screening would cut the number of women dying of breast cancer by a third, it suggested, and there would be no harmful impact.

Forrest said there would be about 3,000 QALYs over 20 years for every 100,000 women who were invited to be screened.

But Raftery and colleagues' analysis of 100,000 women aged 50 or over disputes the Forrest conclusions.

This latest paper claims once harmful effects are included, the QALY benefits are fewer: only 1,500 QALYs after 20 years – half Forrest's estimates.

""At up to eight years the harms generally outweigh the benefits but at 20 years there are greater positive benefits.

Nevertheless, either way the benefit to patients is less than was stated in Forrest"", said Raftery.

Most women who have surgery to remove a suspected cancer do not need the treatment, he added.

""There are lots of women around who have had surgery who believe their lives were saved when in fact only around one in 10 have had their life saved"", he said.

The health department said the study had not altered its belief in screening.

""Our advice has not changed – we urge all women to go for breast screening when invited.

The best available evidence shows that screening saves lives by detecting cancers earlier than they would otherwise have been.

""Our screening programme has always been regularly scrutinised and evaluated"", said a spokesman.

Women between 50 and 70 are currently invited for screening but that is being extended to those aged 47 up to 73.

Cancer charities are also continuing to defend screening.

""We believe breast screening is vital as it can detect breast cancer at the earliest possible stages when no other symptoms are obvious"", said Dr Caitlin Palframan, the policy manager at Breakthrough Breast Cancer.

The new study ""is just one of many analyses of existing screening data"", she said.

Catherine Priestly, a clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care, said calls to its helpline show that ""the differing opinions on screening are causing confusion and anxiety for many people"".

She hoped the review ""will bring clarity to this issue and for those attending screening"", she added.","{""British Medical Journal"": 1}","{""Mike Richards"": 1, ""Harpal Kumar"": 1, ""James Raftery"": 1, ""Raftery"": 2, ""Forrest"": 2, ""Caitlin Palframan"": 1, ""Catherine"": 1, ""Priestly"": 1}","{""the British Medical Journal"": 1, ""the Department of Health"": 1, ""DH"": 1, ""Cancer Research UK"": 1, ""Southampton University"": 1, ""Forrest"": 4, ""Breakthrough Breast Cancer"": 1, ""Breast Cancer Care"": 1}","{""James Raftery"": 1, ""Raftery"": 3, ""Forrest"": 4}","{""the Department of Health"": 1, ""DH"": 1, ""Cancer Research UK"": 1, ""Southampton University"": 1, ""Forrest"": 1, ""Breakthrough Breast Cancer"": 1, ""Breast Cancer Care"": 1}"
18-11-013_telegraph,2011-12-09,Breast cancer screening could cause more harm than good;,"Breast cancer screening often causes more harm than good and is only half as effective as previously thought, according to a new study.Screening programmes are designed to save lives through early diagnosis of cancer, but they also lead to misdiagnosed results and the overtreatment of harmless lumps. 

A new study by Southampton University researchers has found that these negative outcomes for patients cancel out up to half of the benefit that others get from living longer lives. 

This means that for example while screening may give an extra year of life to one breast cancer victim, in another patient it could result in six months worth of suffering due unnecessary treatment 

Previous research has shown that for every 2,000 screenings, 200 women will have a ""false positive"" result - an abnormal result that is later found to be normal - and 10 will have unnecessary surgery, but only one life will be saved. 

This means that for every undetected cancer case doctors pick up, many more women have operations to remove lumps which are either non-cancerous, or are slow developing and pose no threat to life. 

Prof James Raftery, who led the study, said: ""The harms almost exactly outweigh the benefits in terms of life years. 

""To save one life, that woman will have surgery, but 10 more will have surgery that do not need it.

The reason is they have lumps that are diagnosed as cancer but ... most of those lumps would not have gone on to become cancer or to have killed a person."" 

The effectiveness of screening programmes is measured in ""quality of life years"" (QALYs), a measure which weighs up the extra years of life patients gain as a result of screening against the losses of quality of life arising from treatment. 

The 1986 ""Forrest report"" which led to the introduction of breast cancer screening in Britain estimated that the programme would gain patients 3,301 QALYs over a 20-year-period, but did not take into account the potentially harmful results of screening. 

Now a newWord did not find any entries for your table of contents. study published in the British Medical Journal claims that the damaging impact of false positive diagnoses and needless surgery cut this benefit to 1,536 QALYs. 

Researchers analysed the survival rates of 100,000 women aged 50 and over for up to 20 years after they entered the screening programme. 

They found that for 10 years after screening, the years added on to some patients' lives were almost entirely offset by the negative outcomes on life for women who were misdiagnosed or given unnecessary treatment. 

For the first eight years, women were more likely to be harmed than to enjoy any benefit, the researchers said, and only 20 years after screening do the net benefits for patients really begin to accumulate. 

Prof Raftery said: ""At up to eight years, the harms generally outweigh the benefits but at 20 years there are greater positive benefits. 

""Nevertheless, either way, the benefit to patients is less than was stated in Forrest."" 

Patients should be warned about the possible negative effects of screening and more research is needed to find ways of identifying the patients most likely to benefit from surgery, he said. 

""There are lots of women who have had surgery who believe their lives were saved when in fact only around one in 10 have had their life saved. 

""It's very tricky because if you are a woman invited for screening, the harms are upfront in the first few years while the benefits take a lot longer to kick in.

It will take at least five years of screening before a life is saved. 

""If we can ensure that women have a better understanding of the risks of unnecessary treatment before they are screened, it will be better for the patient."" 

A Department of Health spokesperson said an independent review of evidence was under way, but that women should still undergo screening while it is carried out.

A team including scientists from Cardiff University has found evidence that 11 genetic regions have strong links with these diseases, including six not previously observed.

Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia affect about one per cent of the UK population.

The findings, reported by the Psychiatric GenomeWide Association Study Consortium (PGC), are a leap forward in the understanding of these disorders.

Scientists believe they can start to link the genetic variations to the breakdown of brain functions that causes both diseases.

The findings, based on data from tens of thousands of patients, have been published in two papers in the journal Nature Genetics.

Cardiff University's Professor Michael O'Donovan said: ""The genetic variants we have identified are common in the population - everyone carries many of them but people with the disorders carry more.""","{""Nature Genetics"": 1}","{""Michael O'Donovan"": 1}","{""Cardiff University"": 1, ""the Psychiatric GenomeWide Association Study Consortium"": 1, ""PGC"": 1, ""Nature Genetics"": 1, ""Cardiff University's"": 1}","{""Michael O'Donovan"": 1}","{""Cardiff University"": 2, ""the Psychiatric GenomeWide Association Study Consortium"": 1, ""PGC"": 1, ""Nature Genetics"": 1, ""Cardiff University's"": 1}"
04-11-010_independent,2011-09-19,"Genes linked to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder","Broad sweeps of the human genome have exposed genetic mutations that boost the risk of the devastating yet baffling diseases of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, according to two studies published Sunday.

The independent studies, each conducted by a consortium of about 200 scientists, also found significant genetic overlap between the debilitating mental disorders.

Schizophrenia patients typically hear voices that are not real, tend toward paranoia and suffer from disorganized speech and thinking.

The condition is thought to affect about one percent of adults worldwide.

Previously known as manic depression, bipolar disorder is characterised by hard-to-control mood swings that veer back-and-forth between depression and euphoria, and afflicts a similar percentage of the population.

The biological profile of both conditions remain almost entirely unknown.

Doctors seek to hold them in check with powerful drugs.

Scientists have long observed that each syndromes tends to run in families, suggesting a powerful inherited component.

But early hopes of finding a single-gene culprit swiftly faded, giving way to the realisation that - to the extent DNA is at fault - blame is probably spread across dozens, maybe even hundreds of DNA variants.

Genome-wide comparisons made possible by gains in computing power involve sweeps of tens of thousands of individual genetic codes from patients and otherwise healthy counterparts.

But so far only a handful of suspects have been found that, at best, account for about 30 percent of the heritable component of schizophrenia.

Nailing down genetic drivers is made even harder by uncertainty as to whether schizophrenia and bipolar - defined by a varying constellation of symptoms - are single or multiple diseases.

In one of the largest gene sweeps so far, Pablo Gejman of the University of Chicago and colleagues worldwide started by reviewing 17 earlier efforts involving nearly 22,000 people, just under half of them schizophrenia patients.

The so-called meta-study unearthed seven genetic variants, five of them new.

One in particular - known as rs1625579 - plays a key role in regulating brain cells.

To substantiate the results, published in Nature Genetics, the scientists duplicated the genome search with nearly 30,000 other individuals.

For the study on bipolar disorder, also appearing in Nature Genetics, a team led by Pamela Sklar of Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York first looked at the genomes of 7,481 patients and 9,250 healthy individuals.

A second sweep focusing on 34 DNA suspects involved some 2,500 other patients and 42,500 controls.

The study confirmed a significant link with a gene, CACNA1C, that also has been previously associated with schizophrenia.

It also uncovered a new gene variant at another location, known as ODZ4, that suggests neurochemical channels in the brain activated by calcium play a role in boosting the risk of developing the disease.

For both studies, scientists hope that learning more about pathways in the brain affected by the diseases can lead to a better understanding of the causes and drugs to ease or block the symptoms.","{""Nature Genetics"": 2}","{""Pablo Gejman"": 1, ""Pamela Sklar"": 1}","{""the University of Chicago"": 1, ""Nature Genetics"": 2, ""Mount Sinai School of Medicine"": 1}","{""Pablo Gejman"": 1, ""Pamela Sklar"": 1}","{""the University of Chicago"": 1, ""Nature Genetics"": 2, ""Mount Sinai School of Medicine"": 1}"

New research that youngsters are more likely to reach for fattening and sugary foods when they see commercials for unhealthy meals. 

The study by researchers at Liverpool University's Institute of Psychology, Health and Society examined the food preferences of a group of 281 children aged six to 13 years old from the north west of England. 

The children were shown an episode of a popular cartoon before being shown it again two weeks later. 

In each case, the cartoon was preceded by five minutes of commercials - one set showing toy adverts and one showing mainly snacks and fast food. 

After each showing the children were given lists of various food items, both branded and unbranded, and asked what they would like to eat. 

The study found that after viewing the food commercials the children were more likely to pick unhealthy foods. 

Emma Boyland, from the University's Kissileff Laboratory for the Study of Human Ingestive Behaviour, said: ""Obesity in young children is now a major health concern around the world. 

""A 9pm watershed should be introduced so that children are not exposed to high fat, high sugar and high salt food advertising during popular family viewing.""

09-11-009_reuters,2011-09-25,Novartis drug may help older breast cancer patients,"Novartis's bone drug Zometa extended survival in older breast cancer patients but failed to improve disease-free survival among younger women patients in a large-scale clinical trial, researchers said on Sunday.

Detailed data presented at the European Multidisciplinary Cancer Congress (EMCC) in Stockholm showed that Zometa, a bisphosphonate drug known generically as zoledronic acid, only improved overall survival rates in patients who had undergone the menopause at least five years earlier.

Researchers said the effect was likely to be linked to levels of reproductive hormones, which are lower in women who have been through the menopause.

""This is not a treatment for ever woman with breast cancer,"" said Robert Coleman of Britain's Sheffield University, who led the study.

But for women with low levels of female hormones, either due to aging or specific treatments to induce menopause, Zometa ""appears very promising.""

An analysis of the subset of older patients showed that at a the five-year follow-up, there was a 26 percent reduction in recurrence of tumors, Coleman said, as well as a 26 percent reduction in the risk of an early death.

These strong results could lead to ""a major new treatment approach"" for post-menopausal patients, he said.

Zometa, which generated sales of $2.1 billion for Novartis in 2010, is an intravenous drug from a widely used class of osteoporosis medicines called bisphosphonates.

It is increasingly being prescribed to help reduce or delay fractures and other skeletal complications in a variety of cancers that have spread to the bones.

From 65 to 75 percent of breast cancer recurrences occur in the bones.

This trial, called AZURE and also published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Sunday, involved 3,360 women with early-stage breast cancer from 174 centers in Britain, Australia, Spain, Ireland, Portugal, Taiwan and Thailand.

Patients randomly allocated receive standard chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy, either with or without the addition of Zometa, a drug that works by inhibiting the cells that break down bone, called osteoclasts.

The results showed that looking across all trial participants, there was no significant difference in disease-free survival or overall survival between patients who received Zometa and those who didn't.

But in a subset of older patients, the addition of the Novartis drug did bring clear benefits.

These women, who had at least five years since their last period, had an overall survival rate at five years of 85 percent on Zometa compared with 79 percent for those not on the drug.

For all other patients, overall five-year survival was similar, at 86 percent in the Zometa group and 85 percent in the control group.

Investigators said that most surprising among the findings was the drug's effect on the rate at which the cancer recurred outside the bone.

The relative risk for developing metastases, or secondary tumors, outside bone during treatment with Zometa was approximately halved in the postmenopausal women compared with the younger patients.

Coleman said the results shed new light on the role bones may play in the progress of the disease.

""The effects on metastasis and recurrence outside bone suggests that the bone marrow is an important sanctuary for tumor cells which can be activated after, sometimes, many years of dormancy,"" he said.

""With help from bone marrow stem cells, they may then spread via the blood stream to set up metastases at other sites.""","{""the New England Journal of Medicine"": 1}","{""Robert Coleman"": 1, ""Zometa"": 2, ""Coleman"": 2}","{""Novartis"": 3, ""the European Multidisciplinary Cancer Congress (EMCC)"": 1, ""Zometa"": 4, ""Sheffield University"": 1, ""AZURE"": 1, ""the New England Journal of Medicine"": 1}","{""Robert Coleman"": 1, ""Coleman"": 1}","{""Novartis"": 3, ""Zometa"": 3, ""the European Multidisciplinary Cancer Congress (EMCC)"": 1, ""Sheffield University"": 1}"
16-11-001_telegraph,2011-02-11,Chemotherapy patients to benefit from enzyme discovery,"Cancer survival rates could increase following a discovery that will improve chemotherapy treatments. 

Scientists have identified the role of an enzyme that can lead to heart failure among patients who are receiving drugs to kill tumours. 

By creating new drugs to block this enzyme, called NADPH oxidase, researchers will be able to increase the doses of chemotherapy that cancer sufferers can receive and so make the treatment more effective. 

Scientists at Queen's University Belfast hope that in the long run, their discovery will increase cancer survival rates. 

Recent figures suggest that 156,000 people in Britain alone will succumb to the disease this year. 

Dr David Grieve, jointly leading on the research at Queen's School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences said: “While chemotherapy drugs are highly effective in treating a wide range of tumours, they can also cause irreversible damage to the heart. 

This means that doctors are restricted in the doses they can administer to patients. 

In recent years, scientists have been searching for new drugs to prevent these side-effects. 

“Although we have known about the NADPH oxidase enzyme for many years, until now, we were not aware of its crucial role in causing heart damage associated with chemotherapy. 

Our research findings hold clear potential for the creation of new drugs to block the action of the enzyme, which could significantly reduce heart damage in cancer patients. 

“Ultimately, this could allow for the safer use of higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and make the treatment more effective against tumours. 

Despite improved treatments, cancer is currently responsible for 25 per cent of all mortality in the western world.

Their findings could help reduce heart failure in cancer patients - offering them a greater chance of living longer.

Researchers at the Queen's Centre for Vision and Vascular Science have identified the role of the enzyme NADPH oxidase in heart failure.

This means work can now go ahead to make chemotherapy more effective.

When a patient receives chemotherapy, this enzyme can cause life-threatening damage to the heart.

Until now, doctors have had to restrict the number of chemotherapy sessions for patients to protect the heart. 

The downside of this is that the chemotherapy is less effective.

Professor Barbara McDermott and Dr David Grieve are joint leaders of the research at Queen's School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences.

Dr Grieve said: ""While chemotherapy drugs are highly effective in treating a wide range of tumours, they can also cause irreversible damage to the heart. 

""This means that doctors are restricted in the doses they can administer to patients. In recent years, scientists have been searching for new drugs to prevent these side-effects.

""Our research findings hold clear potential for the creation of new drugs to block the action of the enzyme, which could significantly reduce heart damage in cancer patients. 

""Ultimately, this could allow for the safer use of higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and make the treatment more effective against tumours.""

Around 7% of cancer patients treated with the upper limit dosage of chemotherapy agent Doxorubicin currently develop heart failure. 

The scientists examined the adverse effects of doxorubicin, which is a commonly-prescribed chemotherapy agent used to treat a wide range of cancers. 

Other more specific chemotherapy drugs, such as herceptin (which is used to treat breast cancer), are also known to have damaging effects on the heart, although these could occur via different mechanisms. 

Dr Grieve said: ""As doxorubicin is the most widely used chemotherapy agent we chose to focus our research on this, but it is likely that the toxic effects of other chemotherapy drugs on the heart may also involve NADPH oxidase so could be therapeutically targeted in a similar manner.""

Despite improved treatments, cancer remains the cause of 25% of all deaths in the western world.

Scientists at Queen's are now concentrating on defining the precise role of NADPH oxidase in the development of heart failure associated with cancer therapies. 

They hope this could lead to the development of a drug with the potential to save lives.

03-11-026_dailymail,2011-08-30,TWO PIECES OF CHOCOLATE A WEEK 'CUT HEART DISEASE RISK,"EATING chocolate could cut the risk of heart disease and stroke by a third, researchers have said.

But they remain baffled as to why, and believe some of the benefits could simply stem from the 'feel-good' effect of a tasty treat.

The biggest review ever carried out into the subject found that eating at least two pieces of chocolate a week is linked to a 37 per cent drop in the chances of developing cardiovascular disease.

Those who indulged also saw a 29 per cent fall in the risk of stroke compared with those who ate fewer than two squares a week.

Dr Oscar Franco and his colleagues at Cambridge University reviewed seven studies on the effects of chocolate consumption on the heart, which involved 100,000 participants in total.

The studies included chocolate bars, drinks, biscuits and desserts, and did not differentiate between dark and milk.

The findings were presented at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Paris, and published in the British Medical Journal.

Dr Franco did not measure the exact amount that should be consumed, nor did he look at the best type, instead examining only how frequently it was eaten.

Dark chocolate is rated as more beneficial in some studies, he said, probably because it has high levels of cocoa solids.

Chocolate contains around 300 different chemicals, but attempts to isolate the most effective have so far failed.

Dr Franco said: 'Foods are complex and the different ingredients interact to produce an effect.

'We know that eating chocolate releases endorphins in the brain so it may be a matter of chocolate improving people's quality of life.'

But he added: 'We are not recommending people start eating chocolate if they don't already.

Commercially available chocolate is high in calories, and sitting down and eating all you can in one go isn't good for you.'

Victoria Taylor, of the British Heart Foundation, said: 'Evidence does suggest chocolate might have some heart health benefits but we need to find out why.

These also indicated that chocolate can reduce the likelihood of stroke and diabetes.

Scientists have known for some time that a small amount of cocoarich dark chocolate can be good for you because of its high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

But now a review of seven previous studies suggests the benefits may be more widespread.

It found that a high level of choc olate consumption was assoc iated with an average 33 per cent reduction in someone's risk of developing heart disease.

Researchers analysed the studies of more than 100,000 participants with and without existing heart disease.

For each study, they compared the group with the highest chocolate consumption against the group with the lowest consumption.

Five studies reported a beneficial link between higher levels of chocolate consumption and the risk of cardiovascular problems.

They found that the ""highest levels of chocolate consumption were associated with a 37 per cent reduction in cardiovascular disease and a 29 per cent reduction in stroke compared with lowest levels"".

No significant reduction was found in relation to heart failure.

The studies did not differentiate between dark or milk chocolate and included consumption of chocolate bars, drinks, biscuits and desserts.

The authors say the findings need to be interpreted with caution, in particular because chocolate is very high in calories and eating too much of it could lead to weight gain and an increased risk of diabetes.

Researcher Dr Oscar Franco, from the University of Cambridge, said just how eating chocolate affects your heart remains unclear.

He said further studies were needed to test if chocolate causes the reduction or if it can be explained by some other factor.

His findings, published online in the British Medical Journal, will be presented today at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Paris.

Victoria Taylor, senior heart health dietitian at the British Heart Foundation, warned: ""We can't start advisin g people to eat lots of chocolate based on this research.

Why chocolate lovers should be better off than those who shun it is not clear.

It contains antioxidant flavonoids, known to be protective, but also sugar and - especially in the forms popular in the UK - milk powder, which are implicated in weight gain.

Obesity is a well-established cause of serious heart problems.

Dieticians suggested that eating chocolate might be helpful because people find it relaxing.

The study was presented at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in Paris and was published online by the British Medical Journal.

It was undertaken by Dr Oscar Franco and colleagues from Cambridge University, who wanted to try to establish whether a long-speculated association between eating chocolate and reduced risk of heart disease was real.

The scientists carried out a review of all the relevant and most convincing evidence they could find - seven studies involving more than 100,000 people.

They compared the rates of heart disease in those who ate most chocolate with those who ate least.

Five of the seven studies found chocolate - eaten in a variety of forms, from sweet bars to chocolate biscuits and drinking cocoa - to be protective.

They concluded that the ""highest levels of chocolate consumption were associated with a 37% reduction in stroke compared with lowest levels"".

The studies did not differentiate between dark, milk and white chocolate.

They also found no effect on heart failure.

The authors are cautious about the results, warning that chocolate is high in calories - around 500 for every 100 grams - which can cause people to put on weight and lead to heart disease.

But they think the possible benefits should be further explored, including ways to reduce the fat and sugar content of chocolate.

""This paper doesn't really say eat chocolate to improve heart health.

Nor do the authors conclude this either.

What they seem to say is, those who don't deny themselves a sweet treat of chocolate - white or brown - have better cardiovascular outcomes,"" said Catherine Collins, a dietician at St George's Healthcare NHS Trust.

03-11-026_telegraph,2011-08-29,"Chocolate 'cuts heart risk by a third'; Eating chocolate regularly could cut the risk of heart disease by a third, according to the largest analysis of its kind to date.","Those who eat more chocolate have a 37 per cent lower risk of cardiovascular disease than those who eat little, according to a Cambridge University analysis of seven separate studies, containing in total over 100,000 people.

They also have a 29 per cent lower chance of stroke, although they do not have a lower risk of heart failure.

The studies, which followed people in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the US and Japan for about a decade on average, did not focus on dark chocolate alone, which is believed to be the most beneficial type.

Rather, they included consumption of other types including milk chocolate and chocolate bars, drinks, biscuits and desserts.

Dr Oscar Franco, from the university's Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, said no one really understood why chocolate appeared to be so good for heart health.

He said: ""Foods are very complex structures where many substances interact to have a beneficial effect.""

One theory is that chocolate contains large amounts of antioxidants, some of which can help keep the arteries clean.

It could also help people to relax and enjoy life more, he thought.

""Chocolate could be contributing to better quality of life, and that could be one of the mechanisms, but that's just speculation,"" he said.

There was also some evidence that it stimulated the release of endorphins, neurotransmitters that give people a feeling of wellbeing.

Dr Franco presented the results at the annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology in Paris on Monday, while a paper has also been published in the British Medical Journal.

He cautioned that the study did not give people carte blanche to gorge on chocolate - be that dark, milk or white.

He said it only suggested two pieces of chocolate a day; while other studies have indicated a mere 20 to 50g - a small bar's worth - is enough.

""Eat it in a moderate way,"" he advised.

""Over-indulgence should be avoided.""

And while the analysis did not differentiate between different types of chocolate, he said it was clear that dark chocolate was the healthier option, as it contained less sugar and fat.

Health campaigners are worried this type of research sends out the wrong message, and people become confused about what is and is not healthy food.

Victoria Taylor, a senior dietitian at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""We can't start advising people to eat lots of chocolate based on this research.

""If you want to reduce your heart disease risk, there are much better places to start than at the bottom of a box of chocolates.""

Previous studies have found that chocolate, particularly of the dark variety, contains compounds which may reduce the inflammation that leads to heart disease.

The sweet treat is also hailed as having antioxidant properties.

In the latest research, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), experts from the University of Cambridge reviewed seven studies on the issue.

Five reported a positive link between higher levels of chocolate consumption and lower risks of several diseases.

People who ate the most chocolate had a 37 per cent reduced risk of heart disease and a 29 per cent reduction in stroke risk, compared with those eating the least.

One of the studies also found a 31 per cent lower risk of diabetes for chocolate-lovers.

The research, which covered more than 100,000 people, included milk, dark and white chocolate and examined consumption of chocolate bars, drinks, biscuits and desserts.

However, the authors warned that the results should be interpreted with caution, because chocolate is so calorific it can cause weight gain.

Libby Dowling, from Diabetes UK, said: ""On no account should people take away the message that chocolate can reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.""

Previous studies have found that chocolate - particularly of the dark variety - contains compounds which may reduce the inflammation that leads to heart disease.

Now researchers have combined the results of numerous studies to show that chocolate consumption could help reduce the risk of heart disease by almost 40 per cent.

But researchers and health campaigners warned that only small amounts of chocolate were required to have this effect - as little as one square a day - and it should not be seen as an excuse to gorge on unhealthy foods.

In the latest research, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), experts from the University of Cambridge reviewed seven studies on chocolate consumption and links to reduced health risks.

Five of the studies reported a positive link between higher levels of chocolate consumption and lower risks of several diseases.

Overall, people who ate the most chocolate had a 37 per cent reduced risk of heart disease and a 29 per cent reduction in stroke compared with those eating the least.

One of the studies also found a 31 per cent lower risk of diabetes among chocolate-lovers.

But none found a significant reduction in heart failure.

The research, which covered more than 100,000 people, included milk, dark and white chocolate and examined consumption of chocolate bars, drinks, biscuits and desserts.

But none of the studies differentiated between the different types of chocolate to show which might be most effective at reducing risk.

The definition of high consumption was generally regarded as eating chocolate more than once a week or around 7.5g daily - one small square.

However, the authors warned that the results should be interpreted with caution, particularly since commercially available chocolate contains around 500 calories in every 100 grams.

While the health benefits of eating chocolate mean more could be done to reduce its fat and sugar content, further studies are needed, the experts said.

The researchers said: ""Although over-consumption can have harmful effects, the existing studies generally agree on a potential beneficial association of chocolate consumption with a lower risk of cardiometabolic disorders.""

Victoria Taylor, from the British Heart Foundation, said: ""Evidence does suggest chocolate might have some heart health benefits but we need to find out why that might be.

Data from 114,009 patients suggested risk was cut by about a third, according to a study published on the BMJ website.

But the researchers warned that excessive consumption would result in other illnesses.

The British Heart Foundation said there were better ways to protect the heart.

The analysis, conducted by scientists at the University of Cambridge, compared the risk to the brain and heart in groups of people who reported eating low levels of chocolate, fewer than two bars per week, with those eating high levels - more than two bars per week.

It showed that the ""highest levels of chocolate consumption were associated with a 37% reduction in cardiovascular disease and a 29% reduction in stroke compared with the lowest levels"".

One of the researchers, Dr Oscar Franco, said chocolate was known to decrease blood pressure.

He told the BBC the findings were ""promising"", but needed further research to confirm any protective effect.

The study also warns that chocolate can lead to weight gain and Type 2 diabetes.

It suggested that chocolate could one day be used to protect from heart problems and stroke - if the sugar and fat content of chocolate bars was reduced.

03-11-026_reuters,2011-08-29,Is chocolate good for your heart? It depends,"Chocolate may be good for the heart but cardiologists are not giving you a license to indulge.

New research presented at Europe's biggest medical meeting Monday suggested chocolate consumption might be associated with a one third reduction in the risk of developing heart disease.

Just why there should be such a link was unclear, the European Society of Cardiology congress was told.

There has been a string of scientific studies in recent years showing a potential health benefit from eating chocolate.

Dark chocolate, in particular, contains compounds called flavanols thought to be good for the blood system.

In an attempt to paint a clearer picture, Oscar Franco and colleagues from the University of Cambridge pooled results from seven studies involving 100,000 people.

Five of the studies showed a beneficial link between eating chocolate and cardiovascular health, while two did not.

Overall, the findings showed the highest levels of chocolate consumption were associated with a 37 percent reduction in cardiovascular disease and a 29 percent reduction in stroke compared with the lowest levels.

Franco said there were limitations with the pooled analysis, which did not differentiate between dark and milk chocolate, and more research was needed to test whether chocolate actually caused better health outcomes or if it was due to some other confounding factor.

""Evidence does suggest chocolate might have some heart health benefits but we need to find out why that might be,"" said Victoria Taylor, of the British Heart Foundation, who was not involved in the research.

""If you want to reduce your heart disease risk, there are much better places to start than at the bottom of a box of chocolates.""

Franco, whose findings were also published online in the British Medical Journal, said while it seemed chocolate had heart benefits, these could easily be outweighed by the unhealthy nature of much confectionery.

14-11-007_bbcnews,2011-03-12,"Passive smoking increases stillbirth risk, says study","Fathers-to-be should stop smoking to protect their unborn child from the risk of stillbirth or birth defects, scientists say.

University of Nottingham researchers found that pregnant women exposed to smoke at work or home increased their risk of stillbirth by 23% and of having a baby with defects by 13%.

They looked at 19 previous studies from around the world. 

A UK expert said it was ""vital"" women knew the risks of second-hand smoke.

The studies used to pull this research together were carried out in North America, South America, Asia and Europe.

All the studies focused on pregnant women who did not smoke themselves but were passive smokers due to their proximity to a partner who smoked or work colleagues who smoked.

The combined data from the studies suggests that being exposed to more than 10 cigarettes a day is enough for the risks to be increased.

However, the University of Nottingham study did not find an increased risk of miscarriage or newborn death from second-hand smoke - only an increased risk of still birth and birth defects.

The results did not point to a link with any specific congenital birth defect.

Impact on sperm development 

The researchers say fathers who smoke should be more aware of the danger they pose to their unborn child.

Previous research has shown that women who smoke during their pregnancy create serious health risks for their unborn baby, including low birth weight, premature birth and a range of serious birth defects such as cleft palate, club foot and heart problems.

Dr Jo Leonardi-Bee, lead researcher of the study and associate professor in medical statistics at the University of Nottingham, said they still did not know when the effects of the second-hand smoke begin.

""What we still don't know is whether it is the effect of sidestream smoke that the woman inhales that increases these particular risks or whether it is the direct effect of mainstream smoke that the father inhales during smoking that affects sperm development, or possibly both. 

""More research is needed into this issue although we already know that smoking does have an impact on sperm development, so it is very important that men quit smoking before trying for a baby.""

Dr Leonardi-Bee added: ""The risks are related to the amount of cigarettes that are smoked so it is therefore very important for men to cut down.

""Ultimately though, in the interests of their partner and their unborn child, the best option would be to give up completely.""

Andrew Shennan, professor of obstetrics at St. Thomas' Hospital in London and spokesperson for baby charity Tommy's, said: ""It is vital that women are made aware of the possible risks associated with second-hand smoke and alert those around them of the impact it could potentially have on the health of their unborn baby.

14-11-007_reuters,2011-03-07,Secondhand smoke tied to higher birth defect risk,"Women exposed to second-hand smoke while pregnant are more likely to experience a stillbirth or have babies with birth defects, according to an analysis.

Stillbirth was 23 percent more common and birth defects were 13 percent more common among women who lived or worked with smokers, according to a report published in Pediatrics.

""Women need to be protected from passive smoke exposure before conception and throughout pregnancy,"" said Jo Leonardi-Bee, a professor at the University of Nottingham in England and one of the authors of the study, in an email to Reuters Health.

Although the increased risks of stillbirth and birth defects are not massive, she warned: ""They are a lot larger in magnitude than one would anticipate if we believe that passive smoke only has one percent of the effect of active smoking.""

Leonardi-Bee and her colleagues combined data from 19 studies that looked at the effects of sceondhand smoke on the rates of miscarriage, newborn death and birth defects.

The rates of miscarriage and newborn death were similar whether or not women were exposed to secondhand smoke, and when looked at individually, no single birth defect was linked to secondhand smoke.

Only when the researchers pooled the data on all birth defects did they see an increased risk.

None of the women smoked while pregnant, but they breathed in secondhand smoke from colleagues or family members.

In half the studies analyzed, fathers were the primary source of secondhand smoke.

Other medical experts said that the research confirmed what many doctors have assumed about the risks of secondhand smoke, though the findings did not prove that tobacco smoke causes birth defects or stillbirths.

Even if it did, it was unclear if this was due to the mother inhaling the father's secondhand smoke or if his smoking was affecting his sperm.

Stephen Grant of Magee-Womens Research Institute in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who wasn't involved in the study, said he was most intrigued by the association between secondhand smoke and birth defects.

15-11-010_bbcnews,2011-05-05,Drug offers hope for treating muscular dystrophy,"A drug that can boost muscle strength in mice shows promise as a possible treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, research suggests.

The work could one day lead to a daily pill to treat all patients with the muscle-wasting disease, say Oxford University scientists.

About 100 boys are born with the condition in the UK each year.

It causes progressive muscle weakness, with most patients having to use a wheelchair by the age of 12.

The study, published in the journal PLoS ONE, was led by Professor Dame Kay Davies, of Oxford University.

She said: ""We've shown that the drug can dramatically reduce muscle weakness in mice.

""These results give us everything we need to go forward into initial clinical trials in humans.""

There is no effective treatment for the inherited disease - steroid and growth hormones help manage the symptoms but cannot protect muscles from decline.

Muscular dystrophy

Muscular dystrophies are a group of more than 20 different genetic neuromuscular disorders

The most common, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), affects about one in 3,500 boys

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by problems in a gene on the X chromosome that makes a protein called dystrophin, found in muscle fibres 

Muscle fibres break down and are gradually lost

Another form - Becker muscular dystrophy - has similar but milder symptoms

The drug was identified by screening thousands of therapeutic compounds for the ability to raise levels of a substance that boosts muscle strength.

The substance - utrophin - seems to compensate for the lack of a key protein, dystrophin, which does not work properly in muscular dystrophy.

The most promising candidate, named SMT C1100, was tested in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy at three laboratories in Oxford, Italy and the US.

Mice given the drug developed stronger muscles that did not tire as easily and could run 50% further in exercise tasks, the PLoS ONE study found.

Preliminary tests in healthy human volunteers raised no safety concerns but suggest a need for further work to improve the drug's formulation.

Professor Max Parmar, of the Medical Research Council, said: ""This study, without necessarily providing us with the final solution, does gives us an important platform from which to move forward and really make a serious progression through clinical trials.""

Dr Marita Pohlschmidt, director of research at the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, told the BBC: ""At this stage in the game this is very hopeful as it really works in the mice very, very well.

""It's hopeful although you can never tell a family [affected by the disease] when or whether a treatment will come out of it.""

09-11-004_dailymail,2011-06-20,THE PROSTATE CANCER JAB WITH '80% SUCCESS RATE',"A VACCINE that destroys prostate cancer tumours while leaving healthy tissue untouched has been developed.

In tests, the jab wiped out the cancer in 80 per cent of mice suffering from the disease, with no serious side effects. 

Its creators call the gene therapy behind it a 'completely new approach', and say human trials could start within a few years.

ProfessorÊAlan Melcher of the University of Leeds, who co-led the research, said that although the jab had only been tested on prostate tumours, the technique could work on a range of other deadly cancers including breast, lung and pancreatic.

Progress has already been made on a similar treatment for melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer.

'So far it looks safe, and if it continues to look safe there's nothing we would rule out,' Prof Melcher said.

Vaccines work by stimulating the body's immune system to recognise antigens Ð proteins that are found on the surfaces of cells.

Most are designed to teach the body to seek out and destroy viruses or bacteria, but scientists are developing others that provoke a response to cancer cells.

Unlike a conventional vaccine given to prevent infection, this treatment could be used after someone has contracted cancer.

Researchers collected thousands of randomly-selected snippets of genetic code taken from a healthy prostate, and inserted them into a virus.

The modified virus was then cultured in a laboratory and injected into the bloodstreams of a small number of mice with prostate cancer.

The mice's immune systems produced an array of antibodies Ð each one geared up to recognise a different antigen on the surface of a prostate cancer cell.

Professor Richard Vile of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, which also took part in the study, explained: 'The immune system thinks it is being invaded by the viruses, which are expressing cancer-related antigens that should be eliminated.'

The researchers used two versions of the vaccine: one based on human prostate tissue, and the other using mouse tissue.

Both worked, although the human version was more effective, eradicating the cancer in 80 per cent of the mice it was tested on, the teams report in the journal Nature Medicine.

Past attempts at gene therapy cancer vaccines often used just one gene from a tumour cell to stimulate the immune system.

But finding the right gene has been difficult, and scientists feared using two or more would prompt an immune response too strong for the patient to handle.

However, injecting the vaccine into the blood, rather than the tumour itself, appeared to prevent the immune system from going into overdrive and attacking healthy tissue.

Professor Peter Johnson, chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, which funded the Leeds team, said the vaccine 'will need to be further developed and tested in humans before we can tell whether this technique could one day be used to treat cancer patients'.

Each year, around 35,000 men in the UK are diagnosed with prostate cancer and 10,000 die from the disease.","{""Nature Medicine"": 1}","{""\u00caAlan Melcher"": 1, ""Melcher"": 1, ""Richard Vile"": 1, ""Peter Johnson"": 1}","{""the University of Leeds"": 1, ""the Mayo Clinic"": 1, ""Nature Medicine"": 1, ""Cancer Research UK"": 1}","{""\u00caAlan Melcher"": 1, ""Melcher"": 2, ""Richard Vile"": 1}","{""the University of Leeds"": 1, ""the Mayo Clinic"": 1, ""Nature Medicine"": 1, ""Cancer Research UK"": 1}"
09-11-004_mirror,2011-06-20,VIRUS KEY TO CANCER,"CANCER vaccines could become the next generation of therapy after a new method of treatment was discovered.

Scientists have had problems targeting tumours with jabs without causing side effects. 

But they have now taken a ""library of DNA"" from the same organ as a tumour and inserted it into a virus to attack cancers. This wakes up the immune system, which often ignores cancers, and gets the patient's body to fight back against any growths.

Cancer Research UK scientists made ""exciting progress"" by producing doses of a vaccine made from a cattle virus.

They used the DNA injections to successfully treat mice with prostate cancer and hope to use it alongside chemotherapy to kill a range of tumours.

Human trials using different viruses, such as herpes, are already being carried out. The vaccine has the advantage of being injected into blood. Previously they had to be injected directly into tumours, which is difficult.

Prof Alan Melcher led the University of Leeds study, published in the journal Nature Medicine. He said: ""The biggest challenge is developing antigens that can target the tumour without causing harm elsewhere. By using DNA from the same part of the body, we may solve it.

09-11-004_express,2011-06-20,Doctors hail miracle jab which can 'seek and destroy' tumours,"A CANCER jab that can wipe out tumours has been hailed as a major step forward in tackling the disease.

The revolutionary treatment stimulates the immune system so that it seeks out and destroys cancer cells. 

The vaccine will not fully cure cancer but researchers believe it will help make the disease more like a chronic illness than a merciless killer.

Cancer victims given the jab should be able to live much longer with the disease under control.

Scientists from Cancer Research UK and the University of Leeds discovered a DNA-based way to activate the immune system to kill tumours without any side-effects.

Attacked

Normally the immune system does not recognise cancer as a threat and therefore ignores it. The new treatment fools the system into thinking the cancer is a virus and must be attacked.

Along with experts at the Mayo Clinic in the US, they injected doses of the new vaccine into the bloodstream of cancerous mice.

The immune system of the mice reacted and attacked tumours but left healthy cells intact.

Importantly, although the method ""woke up"" the immune system, it did not send it into overdrive.

The research was done on prostate cancer but the technique is also showing promise in treating melanoma, say the researchers, whose work is published in Nature Medicine. The experts say it is also a candidate for treating many of the more aggressive cancers, such as lung, brain and pancreatic cancer.

Professor Alan Melcher, author of the study based at the Cancer Research UK Centre at the University of Leeds, said: ""The biggest challenge in immunology is developing antigens (immune system triggers) that can target the tumour without causing harm elsewhere.

By using DNA from the same part of the body as the tumour, inserted into a virus, we may be able to solve that problem.

""This may not be a cure but it will get the cancer under control meaning people will live longer with it under control. Cancer will become more of a chronic illness than a death sentence.""

It is hoped clinical trials could begin in as little as two or three years. If shown to be as successful in humans, it could help people to live tumour-free with fewer sideeffects than those experienced from current therapies.

Professor Peter Johnson, Cancer Research UK's chief clinician, said: ""This is an interesting and signifi-cant study which could really broaden out the field of immunotherapy research.""

Dr Richard Vile, an immunologist at the Mayo Clinic and a lead author of the study, said: ""We are hopeful that this will overcome some of the major hurdles which we have seen with immunotherapy cancer research.""

Dr Kate Holmes, research manager at The Prostate Cancer Charity, said: ""Significantly, the vaccine developed in this study has shown to not cause any damage to normal, healthy cells in mice whilst helping to kill the prostate tumour.

09-11-004_times,2011-06-20,Hope on prostate cancer after vaccine cures disease in mice,"Cancer sufferers have been given hope of a revolutionary therapy after scientists developed a vaccine that cured prostate cancer in mice.

The jab stimulated the mice's immune system to destroy the tumour, with no side-effects and without the need for any other treatment. Scientists believe that the vaccine could work in humans, and hope to begin trials in about two years. 

Researchers at the University of Leeds and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota created a vaccine using multiple fractions of genes from healthy human prostate tissue. These were inserted into a virus and injected into the bloodstream.

Once in the body, the genes created an array of antigens - proteins which sparked the body's immune system to create antibodies to attack them.

The immune system often does not recognise the antigens on cancer cells as a target, but by delivering many of them at the same time in a virus, the body is stimulated to see them as an enemy.

Crucially, the researchers found that while antibodies attacked the cancer, healthy tissue was left alone. ""Because the cancer also makes these antigens, when the immune system is stimulated in this way, it attacks the tumour,"" said Professor Alan Melcher of the University of Leeds, co-author of the study, published in the journal Nature Medicine.

""The biggest challenge in immunology is developing antigens that can target the tumour without causing harm elsewhere. By using DNA from the same part of the body as the tumour, inserted into a virus, we may be able to solve that problem.""

""It is very early days in terms of applying this to patients. What we can say is that viruses similar to the one that we used here have been used in [vaccine] trials and are looking quite promising, the platform is there and appears safe and deliverable.""

Each year 35,000 men in the UK are diagnosed with prostate cancer and 10,000 die from the disease. Scientists believe that the same approach could be used on other cancers, including some of the deadliest types affecting the lung, brain and pancreas.

09-11-004_bbcnews,2011-06-19,Vaccine hope for prostate cancer sufferers,"A new approach to developing cancer vaccines has been used to treat prostate tumours, an international team of scientists has said.

DNA from healthy cells was used to create a vaccine which cured 80% of mice, Nature Medicine reports.

The researchers believe the principle could be applied to other cancers and have begun studies on melanoma.

Cancer Research UK said it was a significant development, but human trials would be needed.

Cancer vaccines are not new. Unlike traditional vaccines which protect against infection, these work by making the immune system attack tumours already in the body.

Specifically they target markers on the surface of cancerous cells, known as antigens. 

Professor Alan Melcher, of the University of Leeds, said: ""The biggest challenge in immunology is developing antigens that can target the tumour without causing harm elsewhere.""

Mobilising defences:

Researchers in Leeds and at the Mayo Clinic, in the US, broke up chunks of DNA from healthy prostate cells and inserted them into a virus. 

The mice were then repeatedly infected with the virus.

The prostate DNA made the virus produce a wide range of prostate antigens, so when the immune system battled the virus it learned to attack the cancerous prostate cells.

Crucially, healthy prostate cells and other parts of the body were not affected. 

In the lab, a course of nine injections with the virus cured 80% of mice with prostate tumours. 

Professor Melcher said human trials were years rather than months away.



""We have reason to be quite excited. It's not out-of-the-blue research, but based on immunotherpay and virus treatments which are looking very promising and that is what is really exciting,"" he added

Doctors recently claimed that the drug Ipilimumab, which stimulates the immune system to fight cancer, could increase life expectancy.

Researchers say using healthy DNA is a ""proof of principle"" which could have implications for vaccines for other cancers. They are trialing the same technique in mice with skin cancer. 

Professor Peter Johnson, Cancer Research UK's chief clinician, said: ""This is an interesting and significant study which could really broaden out the field of immunotherapy research. 

""Although the vaccine didn't trigger the immune system to overreact and cause serious side effects in mice, it will need to be further developed and tested in humans before we can tell whether this technique could one day be used to treat cancer patients.""

Dr Kate Holmes, research manager at the Prostate Cancer Charity, said the study provided ""new hope"".

""Although we are hopeful that the results of this study could help to form the basis of a new cancer vaccine in future, it is important to remember that the researchers have only investigated the potential of their vaccine in mice.

We look forward to the outcome.""","{""Nature Medicine"": 1}","{""Alan Melcher"": 1, ""Melcher"": 1, ""Peter Johnson"": 1, ""Kate Holmes"": 1}","{""Nature Medicine"": 1, ""the University of Leeds"": 1, ""the Mayo Clinic"": 1, ""Cancer Research UK's"": 1, ""the Prostate Cancer Charity"": 1}","{""Alan Melcher"": 1, ""Melcher"": 1}","{""Nature Medicine"": 1, ""the University of Leeds"": 1, ""the Mayo Clinic"": 1, ""Cancer Research UK's"": 1, ""the Prostate Cancer Charity"": 1}"
09-11-004_reuters,2011-06-19,Scientists develop new approach for cancer vaccine,"LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists have developed a technique that uses a library of DNA taken from organs in which tumors can form and harnesses the body's immune response to create a vaccine designed to treat cancer.

In a study published in the journal Nature Medicine on Sunday, researchers from Britain and the United States said that in early tests in mice with prostate cancer, their experimental vaccine was able to shrink tumors, suggesting it could be developed in future into a treatment for cancer patients.

""Using the immune system to treat cancer is a very exciting area at the moment,"" Alan Melcher of Leeds University, who co-led the study, said in an interview. 

""What we've done is to develop a new approach which builds on a promising foundation.""

He said the method could potentially be used against other forms of cancer such as skin or breast cancer, but added that the research was at an early stage and it would be several years before a vaccine could be developed for testing in humans.

Immunotherapy treatments -- medicines that enlist the help of the body's immune system to fight disease -- are a relatively new form of potential cancer treatment.

An immunotherapy drug called ipilimumab, or Yervoy, made by Bristol-Myers Squibb, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March as the first drug to help advanced melanoma patients live longer.

And last April, the FDA approved Dendreon Corp's Provenge, a therapeutic vaccine designed to stimulate the immune system to attack prostate cancer.

CELLS

Unlike traditional vaccines, therapeutic vaccines are not designed to prevent disease, but to treat it. 

They contain genes to stimulate the immune system to produce proteins called antigens, which activate the immune system to kill cancer cells.

Several drugmakers are trying to develop cancer vaccines but the work is proving difficult because each tumor has specific proteins and identifying the right antigens is tricky. 

There are also concerns that if more genes are used to increase the chances of producing successful antigens, this might trigger an immune response that is too strong for the body to handle.

Working with scientists from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester in the United States, Melcher's team made a vaccine made from a virus which they genetically engineered to contain a ""library"" of DNA including multiple fragments of genes -- and therefore many possible antigens.

They found that this approach did not send the immune system into overdrive. 

Instead, the range of DNA meant the vaccine was able to target the tumor through many routes, they said.

Importantly, the DNA library was harvested from the same organ as the tumor, Melcher explained. 

This meant that the immune system ""self-selected"" the cancer antigens to respond to and did not react against other healthy parts of the body.

""The biggest challenge in immunology is developing antigens that can target the tumor without causing harm elsewhere,"" he said. 

""By using DNA from the same part of the body as the tumor ... we may be able to solve that problem.""

Melcher said his team now planned to develop the technique further and have an experimental vaccine ready for testing in humans within a few years.","{""Nature Medicine"": 1}","{""Alan Melcher"": 1, ""Melcher"": 3}","{""Reuters"": 1, ""Nature Medicine"": 1, ""Leeds University"": 1, ""Bristol-Myers Squibb"": 1, ""the U.S. Food and Drug Administration"": 1, ""FDA"": 2, ""Dendreon Corp's"": 1, ""the Mayo Clinic"": 1}","{""Alan Melcher"": 1, ""Melcher"": 2}","{""Nature Medicine"": 1, ""Leeds University"": 1, ""Bristol-Myers Squibb"": 1, ""the U.S. Food and Drug Administration"": 1, ""FDA"": 2, ""Dendreon Corp's"": 1, ""the Mayo Clinic"": 1}"
19-11-003_bbcnews,2011-02-10,Pain reduced by changing what you look at,"What you look at can influence how much pain you feel, a study has revealed.

Contrary to many people's compulsion to look away during a painful event such as an injection, scientists found that looking at your body - in this case the hand - reduces the pain experienced.

The team also showed that magnifying the hand to make it appear larger cut pain levels further still.

The study, published in Psychological Science, is shedding light on how the brain processes pain.

The researchers say that gaining a better understanding of this could lead to new treatments.

Look away?

The University College London (UCL) and University of Milan-Bicocca research, which was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), was carried out with the help of 18 volunteers.

The scientists applied a heat probe to each participant's hand, gradually increasing the temperature. 

As soon as this began to feel painful, the probe was removed and the temperature was recorded.

Patrick Haggard, professor of cognitive neuroscience from UCL, explained: ""This gives us a measure of the pain threshold, and it is a safe and reliable way of testing when the brain pathways that underline pain become active.""

The scientists then used a set of mirrors to manipulate what the volunteers saw.

The team found that volunteers could tolerate on average 3C more heat when they were looking at their hand in the mirror, compared with when their hand was obscured by a block of wood. 

Professor Haggard said: ""You always advise children not to look when they are having an injection or a blood sample taken, but we have found that looking at the body is analgesic - just looking at the body reduces pain levels.

""So my advice would be to look at your arm, but try to avoid seeing the needle - if that's ""possible. ""



Brain pain

In another experiment, the researchers used convex mirrors to enlarge the appearance of the participant's hand. 

They found that doing so meant the volunteers were able to tolerate higher temperatures. 

Conversely, when the team made the volunteers' hands look smaller, their pain threshold decreased.

The studies are helping to show how pain is processed in the brain 

The researchers said the fact that pain levels were directly proportional to the size the body was viewed at was helping them to better understand the neurological basis of pain.

Professor Haggard said: ""We know quite a lot about the pathways that carry pain signals from the body to the brain, but we know rather less about how the brain processes these signals once they arrive.

""Our interest has been in the relationship between the experience of pain and the representation that your brain makes of your own body. 

""And we've shown there is an interesting interaction between the brain's visual networks and the brain's pain networks."" 

The researchers hope that understanding more about the science underpinning pain could one day help to lead to new treatments for chronic conditions.

Dr Flavia Mancini, lead author of the paper, said: ""Psychological therapies for pain usually focus on the source of pain, for example by changing expectations or attention. 

""However, thinking beyond the pain stimulus, to our body itself, may lead to novel clinical treatments.""

Increasingly there is an interest in what the brain does to pain signals”

And doctors say this is vital.

Dr Paul Nandi, a consultant in pain medicine at UCL Hospitals' Pain Management Centre, said: ""Pain is an enormous problem in the National Health Service and in society generally.

""We do not have precise figures, but it affects several million people in the UK, and it has a huge impact on quality of life.

""It also produces a huge economic burden - if you look at chronic back pain alone, it is estimated that it costs £16bn per annum.

""But this is still widely under-appreciated, and hasn't received the same attention and resources as other areas perceived as 'exciting' in the medical profession.""

However, he said that studies like this could help to drive more research.

Dr Nandi explained: ""A lot of research in the past few years has focussed on identifying targets in the nervous systems that can be used for treatments.

03-11-035_bbcnews,2011-10-07,Severe hypoglycaemia cause found,"The cause of a rare and severe form of hypoglycaemia - or very low levels of sugar in the blood - is genetic, say researchers.

The life-threatening condition means the body does not have enough energy to function.

Scientists at the University of Cambridge say mutations in the AKT2 gene are to blame.

Writing in the journal Science, they say there are already cancer drugs which target a similar process.

Hypoglycaemia can be caused by a disruption in the balance between the hormone insulin and sugar.

Insulin lowers the level of sugar in the blood.

The condition is commonly associated with Type 1 diabetes, when the patients inject too much insulin, miss a meal or drink alcohol.

Rare 

However, one-in-100,000 babies are born with a genetic defect which means they develop hypoglycaemia even when there is no insulin in the blood.

In theory they should have very high blood sugar levels.

These patients have to have a feeding tube inserted directly into the stomach to prevent fits while they are asleep.

One of the researchers, Dr Robert Semple, said: ""Fear of low blood sugar has dominated the lives of these patients and their families.""

Scientists analysed the genetic code of three children with the condition.

All had a mutation in the AKT2 gene.

AKT2 acts as an interpreter for the hormone insulin.

With the mutation, the interpreter acts as though insulin is always present, lowering blood sugar levels.

Lead researcher Prof Stephen O'Rahilly told the BBC that cancer drugs were available which targeted AKT1 and which also act against AKT2.

Excess salt raises blood pressure - and 75 per cent of our intake comes from processed food.

Dr Francesco Cappuccio, of the University of Warwick, called for voluntary or mandatory action to set lower salt targets for manufacturers.

The three-gram cut - or half a teaspoon less each day - would prevent 20,000 deaths by strokes and heart attacks in the UK alone each year, say scientists.

And with three-quarters of the salt coming from processed food, they want limits on how much producers add to their products.

Not only will the reduction to average daily consumption - a government target by 2012 - save lives, it will also save the NHS millions in expensive operations.

The scientists, led by Warwick University's Professor Francesco Cappuccio, also want publicity campaigns and surveys of salt intake. s

Prof Cappuccio, writing online in the British Medical Journal ahead of a UN conference next month, said high blood pressure was the biggest killer of adults worldwide.

He added: ""Evidence from a very wide variety of studies shows a consistent direct relation between salt intake and blood pressure.""

""The blood pressure lowering effect of reducing salt intake is effective in men and women, in all ethnic groups, and all ages.""

The same three-gram cut in the USA would result in up to 120,000 fewer cases of coronary heart disease, up to 66,000 strokes and 99,000 heart attacks annually.

The World Health Organisation wants to lower salt intake globally to less than 5g a day by 2025.

20-11-011_bbcnews,2011-08-12,Cutting salt 'should be global priority',"The UN must make reducing salt intake a global health priority, say UK scientists.

Writing in the British Medical Journal they say a 15% cut in consumption could save 8.5 million lives around the world over the next decade. 

The report says practical steps to reduce consumption should be drawn up without delay.

If voluntary measures do not work, the food industry should be compelled to cut salt levels, it says.

The report - by researchers at the Universities of Warwick and Liverpool - says that after cutting tobacco consumption, getting people to eat less salt would be the most cost effective way to improve global health.

The researchers say there is a ""consistent, direct relation between salt intake and blood pressure"".

High blood pressure in turn is linked to heart disease, stroke and kidney problems.

They point to the US, where cutting salt intake by a third would save tens of thousands of lives and save up to $24 billion annually in health care costs. 

But with 70% of deaths from strokes and heart attacks occurring in developing countries, the report says the impact of reduced intake would be global.

Industry responsibility 

However, the researchers warn that both widespread education and engagement with the food industry will be needed to limit the salt content of processed foods. 

One of the report authors, Professor Francisco Cappucio, of the University of Warwick, said the food industry had a ""huge responsibility"" to take action.

He said: ""The reformulation of food in their hands could deliver a massive impact to public health in the same way that at the moment it is contributing to a huge burden of disease.

""They train your taste buds - the more salt you eat the less salt you taste the more salt you want, to get that saltiness. 

""It is quite a vicious circle, and these circles create profit and it is important that these profits are balanced against the health of the population.""

But Morton Satin, a vice president at the industry body, the Salt Institute, rejected the report out of hand.

He said: ""The salt reduction agenda has become an urban myth - far more based upon populist ideology than objective science.""

Mr Satin said there had been a number of studies in the past year that have questioned the prevailing wisdom on the health damage caused by salt. 

He said: ""This compulsion to regulate is being pushed by a gaggle of activist ideologues who have long ago abandoned science to take up the salt-bashing cudgel.""

Blood pressure cut 

Professor Cappucio pointed to successful salt reduction programmes in Finland, Portugal and Japan which all showed substantial reductions in blood pressure following cutbacks in salt consumption.

He has little time for the efforts of the food and salt industry to re-open the debate on health effects.

""It's no surprise that there has been some antagonism from the food industry, trying to create some false feeling of controversy to confuse consumers.

""There is a covert approach to protect their profits at a time where a reduction in salt intake might erode some of them.""

More Britons than ever have HIV - but their life expectancy after diagnosis has never been higher. Jeremy Laurance reports on how we learnt to live with the Aids virus","Julian Hows is one of the lucky ones. When he was diagnosed with HIV in 1990, the disease was a death sentence. 

Now infection with the virus that causes Aids has become a way of life for almost 100,000 people in Britain. 

Improvements in drug treatment over the past decade have dramatically extended life expectancy for patients with HIV by an average of 16 years, according to research published today.

Julian survived those early years without treatment - the drugs available such as AZT were toxic with unpleasant side-effects and he didn't trust them. ""I left my job, went round the world, did some serious damage to my credit card and came home. Then I realised: 'I am not dead yet'.""

By 2000, when he was seriously ill with pneumonia and shingles, new combination therapy involving a cocktail of drugs was starting to show dramatic improvements. ""There was great suspicion of antiretroviral drugs at first - we didn't know their toxicity or the dosing regime. 

I was fortunate because just as my health began to deteriorate and I needed treatment they started to get it right."" 

More than a decade later, Julian, 56, a programme officer with the Global Network of People Living with HIV in the Netherlands, is living proof of the power of the new drugs. 

But the advance has brought a crisis in its wake. 

The numbers in treatment have trebled since 2000 at a cost of almost £1bn a year. 

Efforts to prevent the disease, condemned as ""woefully inadequate"" by a Lords committee last month, are failing to curb the increase and there are warnings that complacency among young people about the risks has grown, fuelled by the success of treatment.

New diagnoses of HIV acquired in the UK have almost doubled from 1,950 in 2001 to 3,780 in 2010, according to the Health Protection Agency (HPA). 

More than a quarter of those infected have not been tested and are unaware of their condition, increasing the danger to themselves and the risk that they will pass on the infection. 

Research published in the British Medical Journal today shows that the average 20-year-old diagnosed with HIV can now expect to live to their mid-60s. 

The same person diagnosed in the mid-1990s had a life expectancy to age 50. That improvement is down to modern combination drugs that keep the virus in check.

From a killer infection that cut down millions of young men and women in their prime, HIV/Aids has been transformed into a chronic disease that people live with, rather than die from.

Last month's report by the House of Lords HIV and Aids Select Committee noted that just £2.9m was spent on HIV prevention in the UK in the last year compared with £762m on treatment. 

Avoiding one infection saves treatment costs estimated at £280,000-£360,000. 

The HPA said the NHS could have saved £1.2 bn if all 3,780 cases infected in the UK in 2010 had been prevented.

The committee was chaired by Lord Norman Fowler who, as Health Secretary in 1986, launched the ""Don't die of ignorance"" campaign, the first to warn of the Aids pandemic. Lord Fowler said: ""In the last 25 years the development of new drugs has dramatically reduced the death toll but that should not encourage a false sense of security. 

Prevention must be the key policy.""

His words were echoed by the authors of today's BMJ study, based on more than 17,000 patients with HIV, of whom 1,248 died between 1996 and 2008. 

It showed that the earlier patients were diagnosed and the sooner they started treatment the better their outlook.

Doctors assess how far HIV infection has advanced by counting the number of CD4 cells in the blood, a measure of the strength of their immune systems.

The researchers from the University of Bristol, found that patients who were tested and treated early in the course of the infection - when their immune systems, as measured by their CD4 cell counts, were still relatively robust - had the longest life expectancy into their 70s (for those diagnosed at age 20). 

Those who delayed testing and did not start treatment until the disease was advanced had a life expectancy on average only until their 50s.

Mark Gompels, co-author of the study and director of HIV and Aids Services, North Bristol NHS Trust, said: ""These results are very reassuring news for current patients. 

People are frightened of getting tested because they think they are going to die. 

But the message of these results is that they should get tested.""

""Of those who delay and present to us with late-stage HIV infection, 20 per cent die within six months. 

Had they been tested and treated early they would have looked forward to a life expectancy of the kind we report.""

But Dr Gompels admitted ""one worry"" about the success of treatment was that it could make people complacent. ""We must not let that happen,"" he said.

Men who have sex with men are at highest risk of contracting the disease in the UK, with new diagnoses up 70 per cent in the past 10 years. 

An expansion of HIV-testing in the 38 primary care trusts with the highest HIV prevalence was recommended in guidance from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence last March.

For Julian, the future remains bright, though he now faces a new challenge - how to support himself in a retirement he never thought he would see.

""I don't have a pension and I will probably have to work to my late 60s. 

But I would rather be facing the poverty trap than a six-foot box underground.""

Sir Nick Partridge, chief executive of Terrence Higgins Trust, yesterday hailed the advance revealed in the latest research. 

""It demonstrates why it's so much better to know if you have HIV. 

Late diagnosis and late treatment mean an earlier grave, so if you've been at risk for HIV, get tested now.""

Researchers said that over the past 13 years, earlier diagnosis and improvements in antiretroviral treatments had dramatically improved patients' outlook. 

But they said HIV patients still had a lower life expectancy than the general population.

Writing in the British Medical Journal, the Bristol University researchers said HIV infection had become a chronic disease with a good prognosis if treatment began early enough and the patient stuck to their treatment.

Dr Margaret May and her colleagues used data from the UK Collaborative HIV Cohort study, which in 2001 began collating routine data on HIV positive people who had been attending some of the UK's largest clinical centres since January 1996.

Their analysis showed that life expectancy for an average 20-year-old infected with HIV increased from 30 years to almost 46 between the periods of 1996-99 and 2006-8.

Health authorities should consider more widespread testing for HIV, given the benefits of early treatment, UK researchers report in the BMJ.

The Terrence Higgins Trust says people at risk should get tested now.

Figures suggest 80,000 people in the UK carry HIV, and about 25% are unaware they have the infection.

A team led by Dr Margaret May, of the University of Bristol, looked at the life expectancy of the average 20-year-old starting treatment with anti-retroviral drugs between 1996-1999 and 2006-2008.

During that time average life expectancy increased from 30 to almost 46 years from the time of diagnosis, according to the data, reported in the BMJ.

A woman with HIV could expect to live a decade longer than a man with HIV, perhaps because women are tested for HIV during pregnancy and are likely to start treatment earlier, the study found.

Co-author Dr Mark Gompels, of North Bristol NHS trust, said: ""These results are very reassuring news for current patients and will be used to counsel those recently found to be HIV-positive."" 

The data

Data on 17,661 patients, of whom 1,248 (7%) died between 1996 and 2008

Life expectancy for the average 20-year-old with HIV increased from 30 to almost 46 years from the time of diagnosis between the periods 1996-9 and 2006-8

Life expectancy for women treated for HIV was 10 years' higher than for men

Starting anti-retroviral therapy later than guidelines suggest resulted in up to 15 years' loss of life

The HIV and sexual health charity Terrence Higgins Trust said it was good news for people with HIV, their families and friends.

Chief executive Sir Nick Partridge said: ""It also demonstrates why it's so much better to know if you have HIV.

Late diagnosis and late treatment mean an earlier grave, so if you've been at risk for HIV, get tested now. 

""Of course, it's not just length of life that's important, but quality of life too, and having HIV can still severely damage your life's chances.

02-11-040_reuters,2011-10-11,UK study shows how better HIV drugs extend lives,"LONDON(Reuters) - Life expectancy for people in Britain who have HIV rose by 15 years between 1996 and 2008, thanks largely earlier diagnosis and treatment with better, less toxic drugs, scientists said on Wednesday.

While life expectancy for HIV patients is still lower than in the general population, dramatic progress in reducing side effects from drugs, offering them as combination therapies and starting treatment earlier have helped turn HIV into a chronic disease with a good prognosis, the researchers said.

In a study published in the British Medical Journal, the researchers added that the average lifespan of HIV positive patients should increase further with guidelines recommending they start treatment even earlier with modern, improved drugs.

""These results are very reassuring news for current patients and will be used to counsel those recently found to be HIV-positive,"" said Mark Gompels of Britain's North Bristol NHS Trust, who co-led the study.

Around 34 million people globally have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, and the vast majority of them live in sub-Saharan Africa.

Access to screening, diagnosis and early treatment with HIV drugs is limited in many poorer nations, but in wealthy countries like Britain their availability has made a big difference to many patients' lives.

Gompels worked with Margaret May of Bristol University and used data from the UK Collaborative HIV Cohort study, which in 2001 began collating routine data on HIV positive people who had been attending some of Britain's largest clinics since January 1996.

They looked at patients aged 20 and over who started treatment with at least three HIV drugs between 1996 and 2008.

Their analysis showed that life expectancy for an average 20-year-old infected with HIV increased from 30 years to almost 46 between the periods 1996 to 1999 and 2006 to 2008.

""We should expect further improvements for patients starting antiretroviral therapy now with improved modern drugs and new guidelines recommending earlier treatment,"" May said in a statement about the work.

The findings also showed that life expectancy for women treated for HIV in Britain is 10 years higher than for men.

During the period 1996 to 2008, life expectancy was 40 years for male patients and 50 years for female patients, compared with 58 years for men and nearly 62 years for women in the general UK population.

In a comment on the findings, Elena Losina, a senior scientist at the Boston Brigham and Women's Hospital in the United States said that although the progress in Britain was encouraging, it should also serve as ""an urgent call"" to increase awareness among patients and health workers about how effective HIV treatment can be -- especially if started early.

""In turn this should increase rates of routine HIV screening, with timely linkage to care and uninterrupted treatment,"" she said. 

""As these factors improve, the full benefits of treatment for all HIV infected people can be realized.""

14-11-002_dailymail,2011-01-06,'Faulty switch' which affects mind wandering identified in children with ADHD,"Cure

 the incentive is low, then those with ADHD fail to 'switch off' brain regions involved in mind-wandering.

But when there are strong incentives, or when youngsters are taking their medication, their brain activity is the same as for a child without ADHD, according to University of Nottingham researchers.

The study, published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and funded by the Wellcome Trust, involved 18 children with ADHD aged nine to 15.

Their brains were compared with those of 18 similar children without ADHD.

All the children played a computer game that involved hitting green aliens as quickly as possible while avoiding black ones.

The reward for avoiding black aliens was then increased to study the effect of incentives.

Previous studies have shown that children with ADHD have difficulty controlling the part of their brain which gives rise to wandering thoughts or daydreaming.

This part of the brain is normally suppressed when people are focussed on a specific task.

The latest research suggests that children with ADHD have difficulty suppressing this part of their brain unless they are on medication or unless incentives are high.

ADHD is thought to affect between 3 per cent and 7 per cent of school-age children.

Co-author on the study, Dr Martin Batty, said: 'Using brain imaging, we have been able to see inside the children's heads and observe what it is about ADHD that is stopping them concentrating.

'Most people are able to control their 'daydreaming' state and focus on the task at hand.

'This is not the case with children with ADHD.

'If a task is not sufficiently interesting, they cannot switch off their background brain activity and they are easily distracted.

'Making a task more interesting - or providing methylphenidate - turns down the volume and allows them to concentrate.'

Professor Chris Hollis, who led the study, added: 'The results are exciting because for the first time we are beginning to understand how, in children with ADHD, incentives and stimulant medication work in a similar way to alter patterns of brain activity and enable them to concentrate and focus better.

'It also explains why in children with ADHD their performance is often so variable and inconsistent, depending as it does on their interest in a particular task.'","{""the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry"": 1}","{""Martin Batty"": 1, ""Chris"": 1, ""Hollis"": 1}","{""University of Nottingham"": 1, ""the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry"": 1, ""the Wellcome Trust"": 1}","{""Martin Batty"": 1, ""Chris"": 1, ""Hollis"": 1}","{""University of Nottingham"": 1, ""the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry"": 1, ""the Wellcome Trust"": 1}"
14-11-002_telegraph,2011-01-06,Young ADHD sufferers cannot 'switch off' daydreaming brain,"CHILDREN with attention deficit disorder have brains that cannot stop daydreaming, according to a study.

Researchers found that they find it harder to switch off a ""default setting"" of the brain designed to pass the time when not focused on a task.

This means their thoughts are more likely to wander at random when they should be concentrating.

The study, by the University of Nottingham, may explain the physical process behind ADHD sufferers' inability to put their mind on the job at hand.

""You could say that children with ADHD are easily bored but this shows there is a biological basis to it,"" said Prof Chris Hollis, the study leader.

ADHD is the most common mental health disorder in childhood, affecting around one in 50 children in the UK.

Those with ADHD are excessively restless, impulsive and distractible, and experience difficulties at school.

The drug methylphenidate, more often known by the brand name Ritalin, is commonly used to treat the condition.

Using brain scans, researchers have shown that children with ADHD have dif-ficulty in ""switching off"" the default mode network (DMN) in their brains.

This network, which connects various parts of the brain, is usually active when we are doing nothing, giving rise to spontaneous thoughts, but is suppressed when we focus on a task.

In children with ADHD, however, it is thought that the DMN may be insuffi-ciently suppressed on ""boring"" tasks that require focused attention.

Using a video game, researchers compared brain scans of 18 children with ADHD, aged between nine and 15, against scans of a similar group without the condition. The children with ADHD were tested while they were taking their methylphenidate and when they were not.

Researchers were able to show that typically developing children switched off their DMN whenever they saw an item requiring their attention.

However, unless the incentive was high, or they had taken their medication, those with ADHD would fail to switch off their DMN and would perform poorly.

Dr Martin Batty, co-author of the study, said: ""Most people are able to control their 'daydreaming' state and focus on the task at hand. This is not the case with children with ADHD.

03-11-025_express,2011-08-22,Breast tumours can be 'blocked',"A MOLECULE which blocks the development and spread of breast cancer has been discovered by scientists.

The naturally-occurring molecule ""clamps"" on to a cancer-causing protein, preventing it from working.

It is now hoped a drug could be developed to mimic the molecule, which was first discovered in bacteria.

Around 48,000 women are diagnosed every year with breast cancer in Britain and 12,100 die of the disease.

One of the main challenges is to stop the cancer before it spreads to other parts of the body, making it far harder to treat.

The research was published in the journal Nature Chemistry and carried out at Cancer Research UK's Cambridge Research Institute.

Scientists identified a molecule known as thiostrepton, which stops a protein called FOXM1 from working.

Breast cancer cells show increased levels of FOXM1.

It attaches to certain areas of DNA and turns on genes which regulate the growth and division of cells, producing tumours.

It then causes those tumours to spread, even triggering the growth of blood vessels to supply them with nutrients.

Although designing drugs is a huge challenge, the discovery will allow researchers to create molecules which mimic thiostrepton but are even more effective at blocking the effects of FOXM1.

The lead author of the research, Professor Shankar Balasubramanian, said: ""This naturally-occurring molecule doesn't have all the right properties to be used as a treatment itself.

""But this exciting discovery paves the way for the design of more potent and selective drugs based on the structure of thiostrepton.""

Dr Lesley Walker, of Cancer Research UK, said: ""Survival rates for breast cancer have been improving for 30 years thanks to more targeted treatments.

""It's fascinating to discover how a simple bacteria could hold the key to powerful new approaches to stop breast cancer spreading.""

Dr Rachel Greig, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ""This work may also open the door for other molecules to be investigated which could also have cancer blocking potential.""","{""Nature Chemistry"": 1}","{""Shankar Balasubramanian"": 1, ""Lesley Walker"": 1, ""Rachel Greig"": 1}","{""Nature Chemistry"": 1, ""Cancer Research UK's"": 1, ""Cambridge Research Institute"": 1, ""FOXM1"": 1, ""Cancer Research UK"": 1, ""Breakthrough Breast Cancer"": 1}","{""Shankar Balasubramanian"": 1}","{""Nature Chemistry"": 1, ""Cancer Research UK's"": 1, ""Cambridge Research Institute"": 1, ""Cancer Research UK"": 2, ""Breakthrough Breast Cancer"": 1}"
03-11-025_times,2011-08-22,Molecule found in bacteria could help treat breast cancer,"Breast cancer patients could one day be treated with the help of a molecule discovered in bacteria, research suggests.

Thiostrepton, which occurs naturally, blocks a key protein that causes the disease to spread, raising the prospect of drugs that could stop tumours in their tracks.

The researchers, from the University of Cambridge, believe that the molecule could help to tackle the ""notoriously difficult"" task of designing molecules to block proteins involved in the growth of cancers.

If further trials are successful, it could ultimately lead to a new generation of drugs for the 48,000 women in the UK who have breast cancer diagnosed each year.

The researchers looked at how thiostrepton, a molecule largely known for its antibiotic properties, interacted with FOXM1, a cancer-causing protein.

FOXM1 is present in large quantities in breast cancer cells, where it activates genes that control the growth and division of cells, so helping the tumour to spread.

In laboratory models using human breast cancer cells, the researchers found that thiostrepton was able to block FOXM1, making the key genes significantly less active.

The results offer doctors a new avenue that could allow them to halt the development of cancer at an early stage, as well as stopping it spreading.

While thiostrepton is unlikely to be suitable as a treatment itself, scientists now hope to be able to build molecules that mimic its effect, so creating effective targeted drugs.

Professor Shankar Balasubramanian, lead author of the study, published in Nature Chemistry, said: ""Before this research we weren't aware of any natural product which could directly target a protein that controls gene activity.

""Yet intriguingly a molecule in bacteria - which also has strong antibiotic effects - does this very well, switching off cancer-causing genes in breast cancer cells.

""This naturally occurring molecule doesn't have all the right properties to be used as a breast cancer treatment itself.

But this exciting discovery paves the way for the design of more potent and selective drugs based on the structure of thiostrepton to block the FOXM1 protein.""

Lesley Walker, from Cancer Research UK, which helped to fund the study, said: ""Survival rates for breast cancer have been improving for 30 years thanks to the development of more targeted treatments.

But there is more to be done.

One huge challenge is how to prevent breast cancer from spreading to other parts of the body.

Once a cancer has spread it becomes more difficult to treat successfully.

It's fascinating to discover how a simple bacteria could hold the key to powerful new approaches to treat breast cancer developing and spreading.""

Rachel Greig, from Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ""This clever piece of work shows how laboratory research can throw up totally new ideas about how to treat cancer.

""The next step is for scientists to design a treatment that mimics the action of thiostrepton and blocks cancer cells, which could then be useful to stop the spread of breast cancer.

Meanwhile a cancer drug which extends the lives of melanoma sufferers but costs £72,000 for one course of treatment for each patient, goes on the market today in the UK. 

Ipilimumab (brand name Yervoy) is the first new treatment for advanced melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer, since the 1970s.

There are more than 10,000 cases of melanoma a year and 2,000 deaths. 

Ipilimumab boosts the immune system and has been shown in trials to extend the lives of patients with metastatic melanoma (which has spread to other organs) by about ten months.

In a trial, 46 per cent of patients were still alive at one year compared with 25 per cent prescribed a different treatment.

08-11-004_dailymail,2011-02-18,"Got ME? Fatigued patients who go out and exercise have best hope of recovery, finds study","It may seem counter-intuitive to patients suffering with fatigue, but scientists have found encouraging people with ME to push themselves to their limits gives the best hope of recovery.

British researchers conducted the largest trial to date of people with the mysterious and debilitating condition and found that up to 60 per cent of patients improved if therapists encouraged them gradually to do more.

By contrast, patients whose therapists encouraged them to accept the limits of their illness and adapt their lifestyles to live with it showed significantly less improvement when they were followed up after 24 and 52 weeks.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a long-term debilitating condition of disabling physical and mental fatigue, poor concentration and memory, disturbed sleep and muscle and joint pain. 

It also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and affects around 17million people worldwide.

There is currently no cure for it and scientists don't know the cause. 

Many sufferers say they think their illness started after a viral infection, but suggested links to a virus known as XMRV were shown in a recent scientific paper to have been based on contaminated samples in a lab. 

 There is also controversy about what kinds of treatments should be given, with some patients reluctant to accept that psychotherapies might help.

Some patient groups in Britain, where more than a quarter of a million people are estimated to have the condition are concerned that such treatments may even be harmful.

But in this study, which involved 640 patients in Britain, researchers found that CBT and another therapy called gradual exercise therapy (GET) were far more successful than adaptive pacing therapy (APT), in which the patient tries only to match activity levels to the amount of energy they have.

'It is very encouraging that we have found not one but two treatments that are similarly helpful to patients,' said Trudie Chalder from King's College London, who worked on the study and published its findings in the Lancet medical journal today.

All patients in the trial received specialist medical care which included advice about managing the illness and prescribed medicines for symptoms such as insomnia and pain.

The success of the added therapies was measured by patient ratings of fatigue, physical function, overall health and the ability to lead a normal life, plus tests of how far the patient could walk in six minutes, and of sleep, mood and fatigue levels after exertion.

The results showed that CBT and GET benefited up to 60 per cent of patients, and around 30 per cent of patients in each of these treatment groups said their energy levels and ability to function and returned to near normal levels.

External experts commenting on the study said its design was robust and its findings important.

Pacing is less effective, says study","Patients with ME, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, who are encouraged to ""test their limits"" mentally and physically do better than those whose therapies help them to adapt to the condition, research suggests. 

Talking therapy and exercise both proved more effective than treatments which ""pace"" the patient's activity to their energy levels, a study in The Lancet concludes, with twice as many patients making a full recovery.

The study, based on the largest randomised trial of potential treatments, found that only a handful of patients worsened under any of the therapies.

ME (myalgic encephalomyelitis) affects about 250,000 people in Britain, leaving them severely lacking in energy. The cause of the condition remains unclear and evidence on effective treatments had been inconclusive. Professor Trudie Chalder of King's College London, a co-author of the study, said: ""It is very encouraging that we have found not one but two treatments which are similarly helpful to patients, which provides them with a choice. We now need to find out what the common essential ingredient is that makes these treatments work, and which particular types of patients will respond best to which therapy.""

About 30 per cent of patients given cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or graded exercise made a full recovery to normal levels of activity, the study found, while 60 per cent made at least modest improvements. Of patients given pacing therapy, 15 per cent recovered, while 42 per cent made some improvement.

These levels were almost identical in a control group.

Patients' groups said the study did not reflect the results of surveys of sufferers. Sir Peter Spencer, chief executive of Action for ME, said people with ME who were polled rated pacing as the most effective, while a third said that graded exercise made them worse.

In 2009 a US study reported finding a virus in most of the ME sufferers it tested, raising hopes that a physical cause might be discovered. Follow-up studies failed to replicate the findings.

Professor Michael Sharpe of Edinburgh University, a co-author of the study, said the effectiveness of CBT did not necessarily imply a psychological cause.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a long-term debilitating condition of disabling physical and mental fatigue, poor concentration and memory, disturbed sleep and muscle and joint pain. 

It also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and affects around 17 million people worldwide.

There is no cure for CSF/ME and scientists don't know what causes it. 

Many sufferers say they think their illness started after a viral infection, but suggested links to a virus known as XMRV were shown in a recent scientific paper to have been based on contaminated samples in a lab.

There is also controversy about what kinds of treatments should be given, with some patients reluctant to accept that psychotherapies might help.

Some patient groups in Britain, where more than a quarter of a million people are estimated to have CFS/ME, have expressed concern that treatments like cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) that encourage patients to try to overcome or push the limits of their condition may even be harmful.

But in this study, which involved 640 patients in Britain, researchers found that CBT and another therapy called gradual exercise therapy (GET) were far more successful than adaptive pacing therapy (APT), in which the patient tries only to match activity levels to the amount of energy they have.

""It is very encouraging that we have found not one but two treatments that are similarly helpful to patients,"" said Trudie Chalder from King's College London, who worked on the study and published its findings in the Lancet medical journal on Friday.

All patients in the trial received specialist medical care which included advice about managing the illness and prescribed medicines for symptoms such as insomnia and pain.

The success of the added therapies was measured by patient ratings of fatigue, physical function, overall health and the ability to lead a normal life, plus tests of how far the patient could walk in six minutes, and of sleep, mood and fatigue levels after exertion.

The results showed that CBT and GET benefited up to 60 percent of patients, and around 30 percent of patients in each of these treatment groups said their energy levels and ability to function and returned to near normal levels.

External experts commenting on the study said its design was robust and its findings important.

08-11-021_telegraph,2011-06-03,Leukaemia discovery could lead to complete remission,"Scientists have made a discovery that could enable leukaemia sufferers to be completely rid of the disease. 

British researchers found a way to destroy stem cells that sustain the potentially fatal blood cancer, in an early study on mice. 

The team from King’s College London, funded by Cancer Research UK, learned that suppressing two particular proteins stops the leukaemia stem cells growing. 

This could pave the way for better treatment that may enable patients to be in ""complete remission"". 

Prof Peter Johnson, the leading charity’s chief clinician, said: “This study builds on previous Cancer Research UK-funded work trying to pinpoint the molecules responsible for driving the development of MLL-related leukaemia stem cells. 

“Cancer stem cells appear to be more resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy than the other leukaemia cells, so understanding how they originate – and how we can kill them – will be a major step in being able to help even more people survive leukaemia in future.” 

As many as 28,500 people are diagnosed with leukaemia in Britain every year and about 70 per cent of children and 10 per cent of adults have a type that involves mutations of the MLL gene. 

Only half of these children survive for two years after receiving standard treatment. 

But in a paper published in the journal Cell Stem Cell, researchers at King’s describe how they found a way to “abolish” the MLL stem cells. 

They already knew that a protein called Bmi1 played a key role in the survival and growth of cancer stem cells, but also found high levels of another protein, called Hoxa9, in mice and human patients with MLL leukaemia. 

The team was able to suppress both these proteins and so remove the ability of the stem cells to grow. 

Professor Eric So, Head of the Leukaemia and Stem Cell Biology group at King’s, said: “These findings take us a step forward in our understanding of how this devastating disease can return in patients after they have received the standard treatment. 

“Now we know that leukaemic stem cells in certain types of leukaemia, such as MLL, can survive and proliferate independently of the Bmi1 protein, we need to consider more carefully the future of stem cell therapy to treat the disease.

 It’s not as easy as people originally thought it might be. 

“But these findings provide us with vital information that will help us look at alternative ways of combating different forms of the disease, which will ultimately allow patients to achieve long-term complete remission.”","{""Cell Stem Cell"": 1}","{""Peter Johnson"": 1, ""Eric"": 1}","{""King\u2019s College London"": 1, ""Cancer Research UK"": 2, ""Cell Stem Cell"": 1, ""King\u2019s"": 2, ""Leukaemia"": 1, ""Stem Cell Biology"": 1}",,"{""King\u2019s College London"": 1, ""Cancer Research UK"": 2, ""King\u2019s"": 3, ""Cell Stem Cell"": 1, ""Leukaemia"": 1, ""Stem Cell Biology"": 1}"
08-11-021_bbcnews,2011-06-03,Hopes raised of blocking return of leukaemia,"Scientists are working on a way to stop one of the most aggressive forms of acute leukaemia, MLL, returning after a patient has received treatment.

Recurrence of the blood cancer caused by rogue leukaemic stem cells is a major problem for doctors.

But a team at King's College London, working on mice, have raised hopes of a solution.

They describe in the journal Cell Stem Cell how they eliminated the stem cells by suppressing two key proteins.

It is hoped the work, funded by Cancer Research UK and Leukaemia Lymphoma Research, will lead to new treatments which will enable complete remission for patients with a form of acute leukaemia.

Cancer stem cells appear to be more resistant than other leukaemia cells to standard treatments, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

So even after treatment appears to have been initially successful, they can remain to trigger a new round of disease, which often reappears in a more aggressive form.

More than 50% of acute leukaemia patients will relapse and survival is poor, with fewer than half living for five years.

The King's team looked at leukaemic stem cells found in a type of acute leukaemia involving mutations in a gene called MLL.

This particularly aggressive form of the disease accounts for about 70% of infant leukaemias, and 10% of adult acute leukaemias.

Only half of children diagnosed with the disease survive for two years after receiving standard treatment.

Double assault

A protein called Bmi1 was already known to play a key role in the survival and proliferation of various cancer stem cells.

 

But the King's team showed that targeting Bmi1 alone was not enough to eradicate the rogue stem cells, as had previously been thought.

To do that, the scientists found that Bmi1 had to be targeted in harness with a second protein, Hoxa9.

This double assault abolished the ability of MLL mutation to induce leukaemia. 

Researcher Professor Eric So said: ""These findings take us a step forward in our understanding of how this devastating disease can return in patients after they have received the standard treatment.

""Now we know that leukaemic stem cells in certain types of leukaemia, such as MLL, can survive and proliferate independently of the Bmi1 protein, we need to consider more carefully the future of stem cell therapy to treat the disease. 

""It's not as easy as people originally thought it might be."" 

Professor So said the next step would be to pin down exactly how the two proteins help cancer cells to grow.

Professor Peter Johnson, Cancer Research UK's chief clinician, said: ""Cancer stem cells appear to be more resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy than the other leukaemia cells, so understanding how they originate - and how we can kill them - will be a major step in being able to help even more people survive leukaemia in future.""

Dr David Grant, scientific director of Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research, said: ""It is now widely agreed that leukaemia stem cells are the true target for new or existing drugs if patients are to be cured. 

""This research is important in uncovering how leukaemia stem cells are controlled at the genetic level which in turn will guide new treatments to tackle this difficult problem.""","{""Cell Stem Cell"": 1}","{""Eric"": 1, ""Peter Johnson"": 1, ""David Grant"": 1}","{""King's College London"": 1, ""Cell Stem Cell"": 1, ""Cancer Research UK"": 1, ""Leukaemia Lymphoma Research"": 1, ""Cancer Research UK's"": 1, ""Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research"": 1}","{""Eric"": 1}","{""King's College London"": 1, ""Cancer Research UK"": 2, ""Leukaemia Lymphoma Research"": 1, ""Cancer Research UK's"": 1, ""Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research"": 1}"
19-11-001_times,2011-01-01,Love actually is the same for everyone,"Falling in love sets brain circuits racing in the same way, regardless of sex or sexual orientation, according to research.

When lovers think about their beloved, their brains light up in similar fashion whether they are straight or gay, male or female, a brain scanning study published in the journal Public Library of Science One has shown.

In the research, a team led by Professor Semir Zeki and John Romaya, of the Wellcome Laboratory of Neurobiology at University College London, asked 24 volunteers to look at pictures of their partners, while their brains were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging.

The subjects ranged in age from 19 to 47 and reported themselves as being passionately in love and in a sexual relationship. 

They included six straight men, six straight women, six homosexual men and six lesbians.

In each case, the scans showed a similar pattern of brain activity, particularly in regions that are involved in processing feelings of reward.

The lovers' brains also showed considerably lower activity in large parts of the cerebral cortex, which are involved in judgment.

 This may explain why people in love tend to be blind to the faults of their partners, the researchers said.","{""Public Library of Science One"": 1}","{""Semir Zeki"": 1, ""John Romaya"": 1}","{""Public Library of Science One"": 1, ""the Wellcome Laboratory of Neurobiology"": 1, ""University College London"": 1}","{""Semir Zeki"": 1, ""John Romaya"": 1}","{""Public Library of Science One"": 1, ""the Wellcome Laboratory of Neurobiology"": 1, ""University College London"": 1}"

The self-help book that introduced the idea, published in 1992, suggested that when it came to relationships, men and women thought and acted so differently it was as if they were from different planets.

Researchers at University College London said their research showed that we act very similarly when we are in love, whether we are male or female, heterosexual or homosexual.

Prof Semir Zeki and John Romaya looked at brain activity during a love affair.

Twenty four volunteers, aged between 19 and 47, viewed pictures of their romantic partners, as well as pictures of friends of the same sex as their partners but to whom they were romantically indifferent. 

At the same time, their brains were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

The results, published in the journal PLoS One, showed a very similar pattern of activity between the different groups and involved activation of both cortical and subcortical areas, mainly in areas that are rich in dopaminergic (""feel good"") activity. 

Dopaminergic activity is strongly linked to other neurotransmitter activities that are thought to be important in regulating emotional relationships and bonding between individuals.

The research also found that there is extensive deactivation of large parts of the cerebral cortex when lovers view pictures of their romantic partners.

05-11-021_dailymail,2011-07-15,Diesel fumes 'increase the risk of heart attacks',"Diesel fumes are as bad for your heart as they are for the lungs, new research revealed today.

Scientists in Scotland have found that tiny particles produced when diesel burns are harmful to blood vessels and can increase the chances of blood clots forming in arteries, leading to a heart attack or stroke.  

The research by the University of Edinburgh measured the impact of diesel exhaust fumes on healthy volunteers at levels that would be found in heavily polluted cities. 



Scientists compared how people reacted to the gases found in diesel fumes - such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide - with those caused by the ultrafine chemical particles from exhausts.  

The research, funded by the British Heart Foundation, showed that the tiny particles, and not the gases, impaired the function of blood vessels that control how blood is channelled to the body's organs.  

The 'invisible' particles - less than a millionth of a metre wide - can be filtered out of exhaust emissions by fitting special particle traps to vehicles. 

Particle traps are already being fitted retrospectively to public transport vehicles in the US to minimise the potential effects of pollution.  

Dr Mark Miller, of the university's Centre for Cardiovascular Science, said: 'While many people tend to think of the effects of air pollution in terms of damage to the lungs, there is strong evidence that it has an impact on the heart and blood vessels as well. 

'Our research shows that while both gases and particles can affect our blood pressure, it is actually the miniscule chemical particles that are emitted by car exhausts that are really harmful. 

'These particles produce highly reactive molecules called free radicals that can injure our blood vessels and lead to vascular disease.

'We are now investigating which of the chemicals carried by these particles cause these harmful actions, so that in the future we can try and remove these chemicals, and prevent the health effects of vehicle emissions.'

Researchers want environmental health measures that are designed to reduce emissions to be tested to determine whether they reduce the incidence of heart attacks.  

Professor Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'We've known for a long time that air pollution is a major heart health issue and that's why we're funding this team in Edinburgh to continue their vital research.

'Their findings suggest that lives could be saved by cutting these harmful nanoparticles out of exhaust - perhaps by taking them out of the fuel, or making manufacturers add gadgets to their vehicles that can trap particles before they escape.

The best approach isn't clear yet.

05-11-021_express,2011-07-14,DIESEL EXHAUST FUMES CAUSING BLOOD CLOT RISK,"INVISIBLE chemicals in diesel fumes are triggering heart attacks and strokes, an alarming new study has revealed.

Experts have claimed that millions of people could be at risk from microscopic particles produced by burning diesel that can damage blood vessels.The research by Scottish scientists found that breathing in fumes at the levels found on a busy city street for just one hour causes arteries to stiffen and inhibits the body’s ability to break down blood clots, which can lead to heart attacks.They found symptoms are triggered by particles less than a millionth of a metre wide found in diesel fumes.It comes as sales of diesel-powered cars overtook petrol- driven motors for the first time last year as spiralling costs forced cash-strapped motorists to look for more fuel-efficient options.Last year, diesel cars hit an all-time high of 50.6 per cent of the market.Yesterday, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said that diesel vehicles more than 10 years old are the worst polluters as they were built before strict European pollution regulations were introduced.Now health experts are demanding that manufacturers make further improvements to filters on diesel exhausts to reduce the risk of increasing heart disease in heavily polluted cities.Professor Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation (BHF), said: “Their findings suggest that lives could be saved by cutting these harmful nanoparticles out of exhausts – perhaps by taking them out of the fuel, or making manufacturers add gadgets to their vehicles that can trap particles before they escape.”

The team from the University of Edinburgh examined how people reacted to gases found in diesel fumes, including carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide.Published in the European Heart Journal, the study concludes that the microscopic particles contained in the fumes were more harmful than the deadly gases.Dr Mark Miller, of the University of Edinburgh’s Centre for Cardiovascular Science, said: “Our research shows that while both gases and particles can affect our blood pressure, it is actually the minuscule chemical particles that are emitted by car exhausts that are really harmful.“These particles produce highly reactive molecules called free radicals that can injure our blood vessels and lead to vascular disease.”

It comes five years after the BHF advised cyclists to wear face masks to cut down on the amount of diesel fumes they breathe in.A spokesman for the SMMT said: “Generally, emissions before 2000 were a lot higher than they are now.

Since new EU regulations came in, the levels of these gases and particles getting through filters have dropped by 90 per cent.“Those with older cars can have newer filters fitted to cut down on emissions.”",,"{""Jeremy Pearson"": 1, ""Mark Miller"": 1}","{""the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT)"": 1, ""the British Heart Foundation (BHF)"": 1, ""the University of Edinburgh"": 1, ""the European Heart Journal"": 1, ""the University of Edinburgh\u2019s Centre for Cardiovascular Science"": 1, ""BHF"": 1, ""SMMT"": 1, ""EU"": 1}",,"{""EU"": 1}"

05-11-021_reuters,2011-08-02,Bad News: Diesel Particle Emissions Cause Heart Attacks,"Medical researchers at the University of Edinburgh have shown that chemical particles emitted by diesel exhaust fumes significantly increase the risk of heart attack in otherwise healthy adults.

That's right, people: in addition to environmentally damaging carbon emissions, political strife, the deaths of hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians, the contamination of waterways, and devastating ecological impact (even when things are going ""right"", like in Canada) we now have a fresh, new reason to hate big oil.

The research, funded by the British Heart Foundation, showed that it is these tiny diesel particulates, and not the gases, that noticeably impaired the function of small blood vessels and their ability to direct blood flow to the body's organs (the heart, in particular).

These particles can be filtered out of exhaust emissions through the use of particle traps (like those found in AdBlue and Bluetec cars, and those already being retro-fit to public transit vehicles here in the US) but these filters require consistent, expensive maintenance.

Considering the evident health risks, Professor Jeremy Pearson (Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation) believes that policy-makers should clamp down on diesel particle emissions - despite the costs involved - rather sooner than later.

""Our research shows that while both gases and particles can affect our blood pressure, it is actually the miniscule chemical particles ... that are really harmful.

07-11-008_reuters,2011-02-08,"Fear, social change drive down Zimbabwe HIV rates","LONDON (Reuters) - Fear of infection and mass social change have driven a huge decline in HIV rates in Zimbabwe, offering important lessons on how to fight the AIDS epidemic in the rest of Africa, scientists said on Tuesday.

In a study in the journal PLoS Medicine, British researchers said Zimbabwe's epidemic was one of the biggest in the world until the rate of people infected with HIV almost halved, from 29 percent of the population in 1997 to 16 percent in 2007.

Their findings show that Zimbabweans have primarily been motivated to change their sexual behavior because of increased awareness about AIDS deaths which heightened their fears of catching the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes it.

""The HIV epidemic is still very large, with more than one in 10 adults infected today,"" said Timothy Hallett of Imperial College, London, who worked on the study.

""We hope that Zimbabwe and other countries in southern Africa can learn from these lessons and strengthen programs to drive infections down even further.""

Latest data from the United Nations show that an estimated 33.3 million people worldwide are infected with HIV and the majority of those live in sub-Saharan Africa.

The virus can be controlled with cocktails of drugs, but there is no cure and nearly 30 million people have died of HIV-related causes since the disease first emerged in the 1980s.

Simon Gregson, also from Imperial College, and a senior investigator on the study, said that given continuing high HIV/AIDS infection rates in many sub-Saharan African countries, it was important to understand why the disease had taken a such a dramatic downturn in Zimbabwe.

""Very few other countries around the world have seen reductions in HIV infection, and of all African nations, Zimbabwe was thought least likely to see such a turnaround,"" he said.

AIDS experts say that while there have been dramatic gains in the availability AIDS drugs in poor countries in recent years, the fight against the disease -- which is most often transmitted via sex -- will never be won unless prevention efforts can be made more effective.

The United Nations AIDS program said last year that young people in Africa were starting to lead a ""revolution"" in HIV prevention and driving down rates of the disease by having safer sex and fewer sexual partners.

The Imperial College researchers found that in Zimbabwe, a change in attitudes toward numbers of sexual partners was helped by HIV/AIDS prevention programs, which were reinforced through mass media, church leaders and employers.

The poor economic situation in Zimbabwe from the early 2000s would also have driven down the number of concurrent partners a man could have, due to constraints on his wallet, they said.

13-11-013_independent,2011-07-06,Psychiatric patients 'harmed by cutbacks',"The number of people admitted to psychiatric hospitals against their will has increased by more than 60 per cent in the past two decades, a rise closely linked to the overall reduction in hospital beds, according to a study published yesterday.

The unexpected rise in people sectioned under the Mental Health Act across England started as soon as the mass closure of psychiatric units got under way in the early 1980s, continuing despite the widespread introduction of community mental health teams in the last 10 years. 

The study, published in the British Medical Journal, found that for every two psychiatric beds closed, there was one extra involuntary admission the next year. 

Lead author Patrick Keown, consultant psychiatrist and honorary senior lecturer from the Institute of Neuroscience at Newcastle University, said more research was needed to understand the links, but believes some people may be reluctant to return voluntarily to hospital because patient wards had become so busy and ""highly charged"". 

Dr Keown said: ""At a time of austerity within the NHS, it is important to anticipate the consequences of further bed closures and minimise the increase in involuntary admissions because they are longer and more expensive.""

A total of 27,500 adults were detained in an English NHS hospital under the Mental Health Act in 2008 - a 64 per cent rise since 1988. 

his increase is mirrored by a decline in NHS psychiatric beds which fell by 62 per cent to 26,500 in the same period. 

Alison Cobb, of Mind, said: ""The whole system needs to be looked at to see if patients are actually getting any choice in their treatment.

Scientists have discovered that hairy people are better protected from parasites, as the hair makes it harder for the bugs to reach skin.

Bed bugs and other parasites such as mosquitoes, midges and ticks prefer relatively smooth areas, such as the wrists and ankles.

But as the insects search for somewhere to dive in, the nerves in hairs also increase the chances of them being felt on the skin and swatted away.

The discovery may also explain why humans retained a body-covering of fine hair as they evolved.

Hungry bugs placed on shaved arms were more likely to try to feed compared with those on unshaved arms, the journal Biology Letters reported.

Researchers say the hair slows down the bed bugs and warns the victim.

Pest controllers say the UK is currently experiencing a steep rise in the number of bed bug infestations.

Prof Michael Siva-Jothy, from Sheffield University's Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, recruited 29 brave volunteers to test the theory further, watching the bedbugs as they found a place to feed and removing them only as they were about to bite.

He found that more layers of both longer visible hairs and finer, ""vellus"" hairs near the surface appeared to work as a deterrent to the insects, with the finer hairs also acting as an early warning system.

Prof Siva-Jothy said: ""Our findings show that more body hairs mean better detection of parasites - the hairs have nerves attached to them and provide us with the ability to detect displacement.""

He said they also slowed down the insect as it searched for a tasty spot to bite.

""The results have implications for understanding why we look the way we do, what selective forces might have driven us to look the way we do, and may even provide insight for better understanding of how to reduce biting insects' impact on humans.""

However, even though men are naturally hairier than women, they do not appear to be bitten less often.

Professor Siva-Jothy suggested this pointed to an evolutionary battle between bed bugs and their prey, with the insects adapting to automatically head for relatively hairless bits of the body, such as wrists and ankles.

He added that extreme hairiness might also be more of a disadvantage than an advantage.

""If you have a heavy coat of long thick hairs it is easier for parasites to hide, even if you can detect them.

""Our proposal is that we retain the fine covering because it aids detection and if we lost all hair, even the relatively invisible fine hair, our detection ability goes right down.""

Evolutionary pressure 

This tallies with other studies which look at how humans came to be relatively less hairy than apes.

Other scientists have suggested that swapping thicker fur for clothes was a way of making insect bites and parasitic infestations less likely.

Prof Mark Pagel, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Reading, said that biting parasites remain a major cause of disease and death worldwide, making them a potentially enormous evolutionary pressure on early man.

He said: ""This vellus hair is certainly no use for anything else, so it is a reasonable hypothesis that it developed in response to a strong selective pressure in our past.

""Mammals are unique in developing this wonderful fur, and humans are the only mammals to jettison it, so there must have been a very good reason to do so.""","{""Biology Letters"": 1}","{""Michael Siva-Jothy"": 1, ""Siva-Jothy"": 2, ""Mark Pagel"": 1}","{""Biology Letters"": 1, ""Sheffield University's"": 1, ""Department of Animal and Plant Sciences"": 1, ""the University of Reading"": 1}","{""Michael Siva-Jothy"": 1, ""Siva-Jothy"": 3}","{""Sheffield University's"": 1, ""Department of Animal and Plant Sciences"": 1, ""the University of Reading"": 1}"

A report has found that childcare and housework means women are more sensitive to time spent commuting.



They also try to pack in other chores at the same time – such as ferrying children and shopping for food.



Researchers at the London School of Economics and Sheffield University found commuting has a negative effect on women’s mental health while men are, generally, unaffected.



Their research, in the Journal of Health Economics, says women have a greater esponsibility for day-to-day tasks. 



Professor Jennifer Roberts said: “Women, especially those with children, are more likely to add errands to their commute. 



“These make commuting stressful.”

Economics professor Jennifer Roberts of Sheffield University said: ‘Women,  especially those with children, are more likely to add errands to their commute such as food shopping and dropping off and picking up children from childcare.’

Only women who were single and childless, who had flexible work hours or whose partners were main carers for their children were unaffected.

02-11-054_dailymail,2011-10-19,BLOOD PRESSURE PILLS 'HALVE' RISK OF ALZHEIMER'S,"TAKING newer blood pressure drugs cuts the risk of Alzheimer's by up to 50 per cent, British scientists say.

These patients are also less likely to develop vascular dementia Z a condition caused by problems in blood supply to the brain Z than people on older medication.

The first study of its kind opens the door for a treatment that might delay, slow or even prevent dementia.

People with high blood pressure are more at risk of developing Alzheimer's and similar diseases, but some are protected by the drugs they take, the study shows.

Bristol University researchers investigated medication which targets a biochemical pathway called the renin angiotensin system, thought to affect the onset of Alzheimer's.

These drugs Z known as ARBs and ACE inhibitors Z have become increasingly prescribed in the last ten years.

They include ramipril, captopril, losartan, candesartan and valsartan.

Scientists analysed data from 40,000 patients aged over 60 who were being treated for hypertension, or high blood pressure.

One quarter had a type of dementia.

The biggest benefit was for patients taking ARBs, with a 53 per cent drop in risk, compared with patients on ACE inhibitors, who had a 24 per cent lower risk of Alzheimer's or similar condition.

This was compared with those taking blood pressure drugs such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and diuretics Z which have been around longer.

Alzheimer's patients were half as likely to be given ARBs, according to findings published online in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.

Study co-author Dr Patrick Kehoe, a pharmacologist at the Alzheimer's Research UK network in Bristol, said it was not possible to determine the minimum period of time needed to benefit from the drugs.

He explained that they block the effects of a hormone called angiotensin II, which results in the destruction of amyloid plaques in the brain that are the hallmark of Alzheimer's.

The next step is clinical trials to see if the drugs prevent mild cognitive impairment from progressing to full-blown dementia, or delay progression in patients with newly diagnosed Alzheimer's.

Blood pressure guidelines recommend patients under 55 have ARBs and ACE inhibitors, while older drugs are meant to be more effective in older patients.

Professor Peter Sever, an expert on hypertension at Imperial College London, said the study had 'very robust findings'.

More than 820,000 people in the UK have dementia.","{""the Journal of Alzheimer 's Disease"": 1}","{""Patrick Kehoe"": 1, ""Peter Sever"": 1}","{""Bristol University"": 1, ""the Alzheimer's Research UK"": 1, ""Imperial College London"": 1}","{""Patrick Kehoe"": 1}","{""Bristol University"": 1, ""the Alzheimer's Research UK"": 1, ""Imperial College London"": 1}"

A study found those taking ARBs had a 53 per cent reduced Alzheimer's risk, while those on ACE inhibitors had a 24 per cent lower chance.

Alzheimer's Research UK in Bristol said: ""If these findings can be supported in clinical trials, this could be an important step.""",,{},"{""ACE"": 1, ""Alzheimer's Research UK"": 1}",,"{""Alzheimer's Research UK"": 1}"
02-11-054_telegraph,2011-10-18,"Blood pressure drugs could halve risk of Alzheimer's; Drugs commonly used to control high blood pressure could halve the risk of Alzheimer's and substantially reduce the chance of developing another common form of dementia, British research suggests.","Campaigners searching for ways to tackle dementia, which affects more than 800,000 people in Britain, have hailed the findings by academics at Bristol University as ""an important step forward"". 

The study of almost 60,000 people in Britain over 60, found those taking a particular type of blood pressure lowering drug were 50 per cent less likely to develop Alzheimer's, than those on other types of anti-hypertensive medication. 

They were also 25 per cent less likely to develop vascular dementia, the second most common form of the brain-wasting disease. 

The drugs which appear to have the most protective effect are called angiotensin II receptor blockers, or ARBs.

They are commonly prescribed to under 55s to tackle high blood pressure.

Millions are thought to take them already.

These affect the renin angiotensin system, which helps regulate blood pressure and fluid balance. 

Another type of drug to affect this system, called angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (or ACE-Is), also appeared to have a protective effect, although it was only about half as strong. 

Dr Patrick Kehoe of Bristol University's school of clinical sciences and the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, who co-authored the report, said it was the first large-scale trial to find such an association. 

He said: ""If these results are borne out in clinical trials, then we'll have a swathe of drugs that could be used against Alzheimer's. 

""On a personal level I'm very excited because this is something I have been working on for a decade.""

However, he cautioned that their use to combat dementia was ""a little way off"" because the observational study, which used anonymised data from the General Practice Research Database, did not prove causation. 

""That's the million dollar question,"" he added. 

""Nobody should be rushing to their doctor saying they want to be put on these just yet.""

However, results of the trial, published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, did account for underlying differences in blood pressure between individuals. 

This is important because people with high blood pressure are known to be at a higher risk of Alzheimer's and vascular dementia than others. 

Dr Kehoe thus explained that the halving of risk was over and above anything brought about by the drugs' effect on lowering blood pressure. 

He said laboratory studies showed that the drugs interacted with the root causes of Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. 

Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""This study highlights the potential for particular blood pressure drugs to help with Alzheimer's disease.

If these findings can be supported in clinical trials, this could be an important step forward.

05-11-031_dailymail,2011-10-31,AN OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCE? IT'S YOUR BRAIN PLAYING TRICKS,"SOME report feeling as if they are hovering above their own bodies, while others find themselves drawn towards a blinding light.

But out-of-body experiences are nothing more than a trick of the mind, scientists claim.

They say that common spooky scenarios, such as floating above a hospital bed or walking towards the light at the end of a tunnel, can be explained by the brain trying to make sense of the process of death.

Scientists from the universities of Edinburgh and Cambridge reviewed studies into changes in the brain that cause certain sensations associated with near-death experiences.

Researcher Caroline Watt said one common vision Ð that of people seeing a bright light which seems to be drawing them into the afterlife Ð is probably produced by the death of the cells we use to process the light picked up by our eyes and turn it into pictures.

'The most parsimonious explanation is not that you are travelling to some spiritual realm Ð it is simply your brain trying to make sense of the unusual experiences you are having,' Dr Watt said.

Feelings of being out of the body can also be explained by the brain's behaviour, the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences reports.

'If you put on a virtual reality headset showing an image of yourself three feet in front, you can trick your brain into thinking that is you over there, and get the sense you are outside your body,' Dr Watt added.

'The scientific evidence suggests that all aspects of the near-death experience have a biological basis.'

In another example, the hormone noradrenaline, which is released when we suffer from stress and injuries, could be behind the feelings of love and peace many experience when they seem to be approaching death.

However, other scientists say we should not be so quick to dismiss people's accounts.

Sam Parnia, of the University of Southampton, stressed that being able to trace something back to the brain does not mean it is not real. Dr Parnia, who is close to completing a three-year study of hospital patients' recollections of their near-death experiences, said: 'Every experience, whether near-death or otherwise Ð such as depression, happiness and love Ð is mediated by the brain. Ê

'In fact, many experiences share the same brain regions, and so it is not unusual to be able to reproduce them.

'Discovering those areas, or reproducing them, doesn't imply the experience is not real.

'We wouldn't say love, happiness and depression are not real.

'Furthermore, many people accurately report ""seeing"" events taking place at a time when the brain doesn't function, such as during cardiac arrest.

'These cannot be explained by brain changes, since the brain had shut down and ""flatlined"". Ê

'While seeming real to those who experience them, near-death experiences provide a glimpse of what it is like to die for the rest of us.'

Bliss and euphoria 

One of the most frequently reported features of near-death experiences is an awareness of being dead - but the researchers say these feelings are not limited to near-death experiences.

Researchers 

There is a condition called ""Cotard"" - or ""walking corpse"" syndrome, where a person believes they are dead.

It has been seen following trauma and during the advanced stages of typhoid and multiple sclerosis.

Out-of-body experiences, where people feel they are floating above themselves, are also commonly reported.

But Swiss researchers found such experiences could be artificially induced by stimulating the right temporoparietal junction in the brain that plays a role in perception and awareness.

The ""tunnel of light"" sensation reported by those who believe they are having a near-death experience can also be artificially induced.

Pilots flying at G-force can sometimes experience ""hypertensive syncope"" which causes tunnel-like peripheral or even central visual loss for up to eight seconds.

And a US study suggested the light at the end of the tunnel can be explained by poor blood and oxygen supply to the eye.

The feelings of bliss and euphoria, meanwhile, can be recreated with drugs such as ketamine and amphetamine.

The paper also suggests the action of noradrenaline, a hormone released by the mid-brain, can evoke positive emotions, hallucinations and other features of the near-death experience. 

Writing in the journal Trends in Cognitive Science, the researchers say: ""Taken together, the scientific experience suggests that all aspects of near-death experience have a neuro-physiological or psychological basis.""

Dr Sam Parnia, director of resuscitation research at the State University of New York and author of What Happens When We Die said: ""Every experience, whether near-death or otherwise such as depression, happiness and love is mediated by the brain. 

""In fact many experiences share the same brain regions, and so it is not unusual to be able to reproduce them.

Until now, evidence of health improvement has involved waiting a generation or more to measure how many people become ill.

Work by the Glasgow Centre for Population Health has confirmed the link between social factors and the rate at which people age.

Their findings have been published in the Public Library of Science.

The scientists measured the length of telomeres, the tails on the ends of chromosomes, in sample groups in the Glasgow area.

The Telomeres tend to become shorter over a person's lifetime, indicating the speed of the ageing process.

The Glasgow researchers found that, over a 10-year period, telomeres shortened by an average of 7.7% in people whose household income was below £25,000.

For those on higher incomes, the shortening averaged 0.6%.

07-11-010_dailymail,2011-03-01,Fizzy drinks pose heart risk by 'raising blood pressure',"Fizzy drinks and other cans of sugary drink push up blood pressure rates, say British researchers.

Drinking five cans a day could result in someone moving from healthy levels into the high blood pressure zone, they claim.

The 'striking' new findings from a study of over 2,500 people suggest any drink with added sugar or caloric sweeteners adversely affects blood pressure.

For every extra can of sugary drink consumed a day, systolic blood pressure went up by 1.6 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 0.8 mmHg. 

High blood pressure reading is classified as more than140/90 millimetres of mercury. 

The first figure, the systolic pressure, corresponds to the 'surge' that occurs with each heart beat while the diastolic reading is the pressure in the 'resting' stage between beats.

High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke.

Researchers are not clear about why sugary drinks appear to push up blood pressure.

But they may raise uric acid which in turn raises blood pressure by reducing the levels of nitric oxide, a chemical that relaxes the lining of the blood vessels.

The link between sugary drinks and higher blood pressure was especially strong in people who consumed a lot of salt as well as sugar. 

There was some 'weak' evidence that diet drinks were linked with lower blood pressure levels, but it was not a consistent finding, says a report in the medical journal Hypertension.

Professor Paul Elliott, senior author of the study, from the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, said 'It's widely known that if you have too much salt in your diet, you're more likely to develop high blood pressure. 

'The results of this study suggest that people should be careful about how much sugar they consume as well.'

The researchers analysed data from 2,696 volunteers aged between 40 and 59, in eight areas of the US and two areas of the UK. 

On four separate occasions over a period of three weeks on average, the participants reported what they had eaten in the preceding 24 hours, as well as giving urine samples and having their blood pressure measured. 

 The findings applied to any sugar-sweetened drinks, fizzy or still, fruit drinks and lemonade, and drinks with added caloric sweeteners. 



Fruit juices which were 100 per cent fruit were excluded.

For every extra can of sugary drink consumed a day, systolic blood pressure went up by 1.6 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 0.8 mmHg. 

The researchers also found people who drink more sugary drinks had more unhealthy diets and were heavier than non-consumers. 

Those consuming more than one sugar-sweetened beverage a day ate almost 400 more calories a day on average.

But even after taking into account the effect of extra bodyweight on blood pressure, there was still a significant link with sweetened drinks.

Researcher Dr Ian Brown, also from the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, said previous research showed people who reduced their intake of sugary drinks over 18 months had a fall in their blood pressure.

He said 'These are striking findings and the implication is that if you drink five cans a day - and some people do - it could push you from having a normal blood pressure into having high blood pressure.

'This is a population study. It can't say definitively that sugary drinks raise your blood pressure, but it's one piece of the evidence in a jigsaw puzzle.  

'In the meantime, we would advise people who want to drink sugar-sweetened beverages should do so only in moderation.'

Professor Graham MacGregor, chairman of UK charity the Blood Pressure Association, said 'Sweetened soft drinks are a source of hidden calories and may play a role in rising obesity in children, and could be pushing up blood pressure in adults. 

'It's the final nail in the coffin for these drinks.'

Victoria Taylor, Senior Dietitian at the British Heart Foundation, said 'This research doesn’t show us why there might be a link between sugary drinks and high blood pressure so there needs to be some more time spent answering that question. 

'We may know then how much is too much when it comes to these types of drinks. 

'Aside from blood pressure, we do know sugary drinks will add extra calories to our diets and excess calories can lead to obesity, a major risk factor for heart disease.

Researchers who tested 2,700 people, aged 40 to 59, found that their blood pressure increased in line with how many drinks containing glucose and fructose they had each day, irrespective of their build. 

Combining sugary drinks with a high salt diet put participants at even greater risk, said the team from Imperial College, London.

The researchers also found that ""diet"" fizzy drinks had no effect on blood pressure levels because those who opted for such drinks were more likely to be overweight and not exercise.

07-11-010_bbcnews,2011-03-01,Sugary soft drinks linked to high blood pressure,"Drinking too many sugary beverages appears to raise the risk of high blood pressure, experts are warning. 

Findings suggest blood pressure goes up incrementally for every extra can of sugary drink consumed per day.

Drinking more than 355ml a day of sugar-sweetened fruit juice or carbonated drink can be enough to upset the balance, data on over 2,500 people reveals.

The study by UK and US researchers appears in the journal Hypertension.

The precise mechanism behind the link is unclear, but scientists believe too much sugar in the blood disrupts blood vessel tone and salt levels in the body. 

Non-sugar sweetened diet drinks did not carry the same risk.

The soft drink industry maintains that the beverages are safe to drink ""in moderation"".

The American Heart Association says people should drink no more than three 355ml cans of soda a week.

For the study, the participants who were aged 40-59 from the UK and the US were asked to record what they had eaten in the preceding 24 hours on four separate occasions. 

They also provided a urine sample and had their blood pressure measured.

The researchers found that sugar intake was highest in those consuming more than one sugar-sweetened beverage daily. 

They also found that individuals consuming more than one serving per day of sugar-sweetened beverages consumed more calories than those who didn't consume sugary drinks - around 397 extra calories a day. 

For every extra can of sugary drink consumed per day, participants on average had a higher systolic blood pressure by 1.6mmHg and a higher diastolic blood pressure by 0.8mmHg. 

Overall, the people who consumed a lot of sugar-sweetened beverages appeared to also have less healthy diets and were more likely to be overweight. 

But regardless of this, the link with blood pressure was still significant even after adjusting for factors such as weight and height.

Stroke risk

Professor Paul Elliott, senior author of the study, from the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, said: ""It's widely known that if you have too much salt in your diet, you're more likely to develop high blood pressure. 

""The results of this study suggest that people should be careful about how much sugar they consume as well.""

High blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

Someone with a blood pressure level of 135mmHg over 85mmHg is twice as likely to have a heart attack or stroke as someone with a reading of 115mmHg over 75mmHg.

In the study, the link between sugary drinks and higher blood pressure was especially strong in people who consumed a lot of salt as well as sugar. 

Excess salt in the diet is already a known to contribute to high blood pressure.

The British Heart Foundation said more research was now needed to better understand the relationship between sugar and blood pressure.

Victoria Taylor, Senior Dietician at the BHF, said it was best to avoid too many sugary drinks because they add extra calories to our diets that can lead to obesity, a major risk factor for heart disease.

Professor Graham MacGregor, chairman of the Blood Pressure Association said: ""This is another nail in the coffin for soft drinks.

Researchers at the University of Glasgow have discovered how a protein linked to the mental health condition acts as a switch to control key stages in the development of the brain.

It is hoped the findings could lead to the development of drugs which can correct defects in brain function which trigger schizophrenia, as well as mood disorders and autism.

Schizophrenia sufferers experience symptoms such as hearing voices, paranoid delusions and muddled thought or speech.

According to the latest figures, around 3,000 people in Scotland are admitted to hospital every year with the disorder.

Study leader Professor Miles Houslay, of the Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology at the University of Glasgow, said:

""Schizophrenia, mood disorders and autism cause great emotional and financial hardships for individuals, their families and for society as a whole.

""Because of this we desperately need to know what goes wrong in the brain that leads to these debilitating conditions.""

06-11-010_scotsman,2011-05-12,Scottish experts aiming to switch off schizophrenia,"SCOTS scientists have raised hope of new treatments for schizophrenia.

The team, from Glasgow University, focused their attention on a protein in the body known as DISC1, which plays a role in brain development.

Researchers found that defects in the protein could be rectified with drugs to combat their effects on schizophrenia.

The research, published in the journal Nature, opens up the prospects of new ways of tackling the condition, which affects between two and four people per 1,000 in the UK population.

It has been widely thought that DISC1, which plays a vital role in the development of the brain cortex, may also influence the risk of schizophrenia and other disorders such as autism.

This part of the brain is responsible for functions such as memory, attention, thought, language and consciousness, but until now it was not clear how defects in this area developed to cause mental health problems.

The DISC1 protein acts as a ""control centre"" in the brain by recruiting other types of protein and attracting them together on the surface where they can work to control brain development.

Professor Miles Houslay, of the Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology at Glasgow University, said: ""While it is now well-recognised that DISC1 is a major susceptibility factor for these brain diseases, we still don't understand enough about the range of processes it controls and how they go wrong in mental illness.""

But the researchers, working with US colleagues from Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, Duke University in North Carolina and scientists at Keio University, Tokyo, have now moved a step closer to understanding how the protein could be harnessed for new treatments.

They showed that DISC1 acts as a ""molecular switch"" that controls two key stages in the development of the cortex.

One of these stages involves how cells in the cortex multiply in development, while the other relates to how brain cells migrate within the cortex to specific locations that allow them to work properly.

This knowledge could be used to design drugs able to correct any defects which lead to problems developing.

""These processes are critical for normal brain function,"" Prof Houslay said.

""However, as these new results show that DISC1 is a protein whose function can be dynamically regulated, it opens up the possibility of pharmaceutical and biotech companies designing new medicines able to correct defects in DISC1 that lead to the debilitating disease of schizophrenia.""

05-11-005_scotsman,2011-02-08,New pinpoint treatment aims to cut side-effects of chemotherapy,"Scottish scientists have developed a way to potentially deliver chemotherapy to cancer patients with fewer side-effects.

The researchers, from Edinburgh University, have created a device that is able to trigger a reaction in specific cells.

This could enable cancer drugs to be activated at the site of a tumour, targeting treatment to a certain area while protecting the cells around it.

Targeting drug treatment where it is needed should safeguard the rest of the patient's body and help curb side-effects linked to chemotherapy. 

Many patients undergoing these aggressive treatments can suffer effects such as hair loss, sickness and weakened immunity.

Scientists are increasingly looking for new ways of tailoring treatments with the aim of making them more effective and causing fewer problems.

While such drugs can be expensive, experts hope that by making them more successful they will prove cost effective in the longer term.

The new device being developed in Edinburgh works by delivering tiny quantities of palladium, a metal not naturally found in human cells. 

It helps trigger reactions in the cell without altering their normal functions, such as producing proteins and metabolising energy.

Researchers combined tiny particles of palladium with a harmless material that enables it to enter living cells.

They found that, in the lab, the metal was able to trigger specific reactions in the cell without having any effects elsewhere.

In practice, the palladium could be injected into the site of the cancer which doctors want to target.

It is hoped that cancer drugs could then be designed to only target cells treated with palladium, or another substance, and not affect healthy cells nearby.

Although the research is at an early stage, scientists believe the technique could be developed to allow better treatment for patients with cancer.

The discovery could pave the way for delivering other therapies to where they are needed in the body, scientists said.

And it could also be used to deliver dyes to organs which are used in some diagnostic tests.

Professor Mark Bradley, from the university's School of Chemistry, who led the research, said: ""This technique potentially gives us the ability to deliver drugs to exactly where they are needed, for example in targeting cancerous tumours.""

Researcher Dr Emma Johansson said the technique was still in the early stages of development, but they believed it had the potential to be useful in future drug development and the method could also be used in treating other diseases.

The study, published in the journal Nature Chemistry, was carried out in collaboration with the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the Royal Society, the government of Malaysia and the Swiss National Science Foundation.

But research suggests that they might be better advised to bite their tongue Z as lack of confidence is a factor in women's tendency to struggle in tasks requiring spatial awareness.

Tests showed that women improved in these activities when their self-belief was given a boost.

University of Warwick psychology researcher Dr Zachary Estes, working with Dr Sydney Felker from the University of Georgia Health Centre, looked at the ability of 545 U.S. students to perform a standard 3D mental rotation task, while at the same time manipulating their confidence levels.

Dr Estes, whose research paper is published in the journal Archives Of Sexual Behaviour, said: 'Prior research shows that women tend to do poorly on tasks that require spatial awareness.

Women behind the wheel have been the butt of sexist barbs by their male counterparts for decades. 

But now psychologists have found evidence that jokes about female drivers could be a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

A joint study by researchers at the University of Warwick and the University of Georgia in the US found evidence that self belief was important for a woman's performance in spatial tasks which might naturally favour men. 

It suggested that confidence-knocking jokes were likely to reduce a woman's performance behind the wheel while they performed better when it was boosted, the study suggested. 

The findings of the study co-authored by Dr Zachary Estes, of Warwick, and Dr Sydney Felker from the University of Georgia, have been published in the US journal Archives of Sexual Behavior. 

The researchers asked more than 500 US college students to perform a variety of spatial tasks, deliberately chosen to favour men.

They were divided into several groups along gender lines. 

In some tests, the participants' confidence was manipulated by offering positive or negative feedback on their performance. 

In one test half of the groups were made to monitor their own confidence levels while the other half were not. 

The researchers noted that when the female groups had to monitor their confidence levels they fared less well than men. 

But when they were left to their own devices they performed equally well as their male counterparts. 

In another test some participants were showered with praise while another was not.

Those given the praise appeared to fare better in the next task. 

Those women who were praised tended to fare as well as their male counterparts in tasks which were thought to favour men. 

""Prior research shows that women tend to do poorly on tasks that require spatial awareness,"" said Dr Estes. 

""That is borne out in the common jokes we always hear about men being better at parking and map reading than women.

The disease mainly affects the middle aged, but a study suggests that susceptibility could be programmed into the cells of an unborn baby if his or her mother eats unhealthily.

In theory, this diabetes vulnerability gene could then be passed down to the child’s offspring and future generations.

Cambridge University scientists pinpointed the gene in tests on rats that showed it was reprogrammed in the womb by a protein-deficient diet given to the mother.

Other research suggests a range of unbalanced diets may result in an increased risk of diabetes, not just protein-restricted ones.

The Cambridge team, whose work is published in the journal Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences, focused on a ‘master regulator’ metabolism gene that is important both in the development of the pancreas in the womb and its ability to produce insulin.

 Feeding mother rats a low-protein diet reduced the gene’s activity, decreased insulin production and made the offspring prone to developing type 2 diabetes in later life.

03-11-013_guardian,2011-03-07,Your mother's diet in pregnancy may affect your risk of ageing diseases,"An unbalanced diet in pregnancy can increase children's odds of getting ageing-related illnesses like type 2 diabetes in later life, research on rats suggests

Women who have a poor diet during pregnancy may have children who are more susceptible to age-related diseases than those who have a healthier diet, scientists say.

The warning comes after research found that rats that had poor nutrition during pregnancy gave birth to young with a high risk of type 2 diabetes, an illness that typically strikes in middle age.

Researchers at Cambridge University traced back the effect to subtle genetic changes that normally accumulate with age. 

Similar changes are likely to occur in humans.

The work is believed to be the first evidence that poor maternal diet during pregnancy can make people more vulnerable to the effects of ageing.

Type 2 diabetes affects the way the body produces and responds to insulin, a hormone made by beta cells in the pancreas. 

The disease is mostly diagnosed in the over-40s, but is becoming more common in younger people.

Scientists led by Susan Ozanne at the Institute of Metabolic Science in Cambridge found that a poor maternal diet led to so-called epigenetic changes that reduced the activity of a gene called Hnf4a in a mother's young. 

The gene governs how many insulin-producing cells grow in the pancreas and the organ's ability to respond to high levels of glucose in the blood.

""It's well known that maternal diet and growth of the fetus in the womb impact on the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in later life, but we haven't known the mechanism before,"" Ozanne said.

Writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers describe how the Hnf4a gene was steadily silenced as all the rats got older. 

But those born to mothers fed on a bad diet began life with much lower levels of gene activity and developed diabetes sooner.

In the study, rats were fed on either a nutritionally poor diet of 8% protein, or a normal diet containing 20% protein. 

Both had the same number of calories.

While genetic mutations can have an immediate effect on a person's health, epigenetic changes are more subtle and can take decades to cause problems.

""It is remarkable that maternal diet can mark our genes so they remember events in very early life,"" said Miguel Constancia, a co-author on the paper.

People born to mothers who ate badly during their pregnancy are not destined to develop the illness, Ozanne said. 

""Diabetes is a very multifactorial disease and poor nutrition and growth in early life is just one risk factor.

""It doesn't mean you will definitely get type 2 diabetes, it just increases your risk. 

If you have that risk, it is probably a good idea to ensure your adult lifestyle is going to reduce other risks, for example by having a very active life, eating a good diet and not smoking,"" Ozanne said.","{""Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences"": 1}","{""Susan Ozanne"": 1, ""Ozanne"": 3, ""Miguel Constancia"": 1}","{""Cambridge University"": 1, ""the Institute of Metabolic Science"": 1, ""Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences"": 1}","{""Susan Ozanne"": 1, ""Ozanne"": 1, ""Miguel Constancia"": 1}","{""Cambridge University"": 1, ""the Institute of Metabolic Science"": 1}"
03-11-013_bbcnews,2011-03-08,Scientists find link between maternal diet and diabetes,"Scientists say they have found a mechanism which may explain why a poor diet during pregnancy can increase the risk of offspring developing diabetes in later life. 

They say rat studies indicate an imbalanced diet in the mother can lead to the ""silencing"" of a gene linked to insulin production in the child. 

The Cambridge study is in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 

Experts said it showed a healthy diet was important during pregnancy.

Silent gene 

Scientists already suspect that a poor diet during pregnancy can result in health problems such as diabetes for the offspring in later life.

 What the researchers at the University of Cambridge have come up with is a possible explanation. 

They believe an imbalanced diet in the expectant mother can compromise the long-term functioning of a gene in the child.

The gene, called Hnf4a, is thought to play a role in the development of the pancreas and in insulin production. 

Because of the difficulties of testing the theory on pregnant women, they fed rats a protein-deficient diet and found higher rates of type 2 diabetes in the offspring, as expected. 

What they also found in the offspring was that this Hnf4a gene appeared to be ""silenced"" or ""switched off"" as the rats aged.

 The researchers suggest this may both cause diabetes, and can be linked back to the maternal diet.

Dr Susan Ozanne of the University of Cambridge, who lead the study, said further research would be needed to establish whether high-fat diets or other imbalanced diets had similar consequences in rats.

She believes similar mechanisms to those seen in the study could occur in humans, and that the effects might be felt by more than just the immediate offspring.

""Having a healthy well-balanced diet any time in your life is important for your health,"" she said, ""but a healthy well-balanced diet during pregnancy is particularly important because of the impact on the baby long-term and potentially even on the grandchildren as well.""

Earliest stages 

Type 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity, although several inheritable genes have also been linked to the condition. 

This latest study focuses on what are called the ""epigenetic"" mechanisms which can affect whether a gene is expressed or not. 

Other studies have shown that these changes can be passed across generations without any modifications to our core DNA. 

Professor Jeremy Pearson of the British Heart Foundation said the research did not change the advice to pregnant women to eat a healthy, balanced diet, and said there was no reason for expectant mothers to be unduly worried.

19-11-004_bbcnews,2011-05-20,Crossing your arms 'relieves hand pain',"Crossing your arms across your body after injury to the hand could relieve pain, researchers suggest.

The University College London team, who undertook a proof-of-concept study of 20 people, say the brain gets confused over where pain has occurred.

In the journal Pain, they suggest this is because putting hands on the ""wrong"" sides disrupts sensory perception.

Pain experts say finding ways of confusing the brain is the focus of many studies.

The team used a laser to generate a four millisecond pin-prick of pain to participants' hands, without touching them.

Each person ranked the intensity of the pain they felt, and their electrical brain responses were also measured using electroencephalography (EEG). 

The results from both participants' reports and the EEG showed that the perception of pain was weaker when the arms were crossed over the ""midline"" - an imaginary line running vertically down the centre of the body.

Activation 

Dr Giandomenico Iannetti, from the UCL department of physiology, pharmacology and neuroscience, who led the research, said: ""In everyday life you mostly use your left hand to touch things on the left side of the world, and your right hand for the right side of the world. 

""This means that the areas of the brain that contain the map of the right body and the map of right external space are usually activated together, leading to highly effective processing of sensory stimuli. 

""When you cross your arms these maps are not activated together anymore, leading to less effective brain processing of sensory stimuli, including pain, being perceived as weaker.""

He said the discovery could potentially lead to new ways of treating pain that exploit this confusion.

Dr Iannetti he added: ""Perhaps when we get hurt, we should not only 'rub it better' but also cross our arms."" 

His team, alongside Australian researchers, are now testing the theory on patients who have chronic pain conditions.

A spokesman for the Pain Relief Foundation said a lot of research into relieving chronic pain was looking into ways of confusing the brain and disrupting pain messages.","{""Pain"": 1}","{""Giandomenico Iannetti"": 1, ""Iannetti"": 1}","{""University College London"": 1, ""EEG"": 1, ""UCL"": 1, ""the Pain Relief Foundation"": 1}","{""Giandomenico Iannetti"": 1, ""Iannetti"": 2}","{""University College London"": 1, ""UCL"": 1, ""the Pain Relief Foundation"": 1}"
05-11-012_bbcnews,2011-04-11,Gene APOE4 could help nerve repair after injury,"Scientists have found a gene which controls how quickly a person's nerves can regenerate after injury or disease.

Edinburgh University researchers said the find could help the understanding and treatment of motor neurone disease and carpal tunnel syndrome.

They said it could also help to predict how quickly a person's nerves would recover from a severe physical trauma, such as a car accident.

They have found a form of the gene, apolipoprotein E (APOE), called APOE4.

Researchers were already aware E (APOE) controlled how quickly nerve cells repaired themselves in the brains of people affected by conditions such as stroke or Alzheimer's disease.

However, the study showed for the first time that one form of the gene, APOE4, slowed the regrowth of nerves outside the brain and spinal cord, including nerves that connect to muscles in the arms and legs and those that carry sensory information from the skin.

Genetic make-up 

The team said it may now be possible to identify patients who will have a slow recovery after nerve injury, or who are likely to have poorer responses to treatments for conditions such as motor neurone disease, by examining their genes.

The research was conducted in mice, however, about one in three humans carry the E4 version of the gene.

Professor Tom Gillingwater, of Edinburgh University, said: ""This research helps us to understand how a person's genetic make-up can determine how likely they are to recover from nerve injury or disease.

""Identifying genes that control regeneration of the nervous system therefore takes us one step closer to developing personalised treatments that improve nerve re-growth and speed up recovery.""

02-11-036_guardian,2011-09-20,Smoking in films 'should get automatic 18 rating',"Films that depict actors smoking should be handed an automatic 18 certificate, according to research published by the British Medical Journal.

The report, produced by researchers from the UK Centre for Tobacco Control Studies, called for movies that feature smoking to attract a similar age classification to those that portray sex or violence.

Their study of more than 5,000 adolescents found that 15-year-olds who saw the most films showing actors smoking were 73% more likely to have tried it than those who had seen the fewest.

Dr Andrea Waylen, from the University of Bristol's school of oral and dental sciences, said: ""More than half the films shown in the UK that contain smoking are rated 15 or below, so children and young teenagers are clearly exposed.

""Our results confirm an association between this exposure and youth smoking in this country, indicating that raising the certification to 18 in the UK is likely to lower smoking rates among youth.

""Given that smoking depictions in films are not consistent with the ban on smoking in public places in the UK and that the relationship may be causal, a precautionary principle should be pursued.

Films ought to be rated by exposure to smoking in the same way that they are currently rated by level of violence.""

Respondents to the survey were asked whether they had seen 50 films randomly selected from 366 box-office hits between 2001 and 2005, including Spider-Man, Bridget Jones and The Matrix.

Those who had seen the most films in which smoking was shown on screen were almost 50% more likely to be a smoker than those who had seen the least.

Smoking in movies has often been associated with glamour, particularly in the early years of Hollywood when actors such as Audrey Hepburn were regularly seen puffing on a cigarette in films such as Breakfast at Tiffany's.

Despite changes in attitudes towards smoking in subsequent decades and stringent calls from campaigners for new guidelines, film-makers remain free to portray the habit on screen without fear of censorship.

In response to the latest report, the British Board of Film Classification said its current guidelines were ""proportionate; take due account of the available evidence of harm; and reflect the clear wishes of the public"".

Director David Cooke said: ""Glamorising smoking has been included as a classification issue in our published classification guidelines.

There is, however, no public support for automatically classifying, for instance, a PG film at 18 just because it happens to contain a scene of smoking.""

Five films that children might be banned from viewing if smoking attracted an 18 certificate

The Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001-2003)

Gandalf the wizard has a huge fondness for smoking tobacco through a pipe in Peter Jackson's fantasy trilogy based on the novels by JRR Tolkien (himself a keen smoker).

Hobbits Pippin and Merry also enjoy a puff of the Shire's finest pipe-weed.

101 Dalmations(1996)

Glenn Close's Cruella DeVille (via a sleek 20s-style cigarette holder called a quellazaire) is rarely seen without a fag poking from her lips.

Peter Pan (1953)

Captain Hook takes his smoking habit to extremes in Disney's animated tale, via a holder that allows him to inhale from two cigars at once.

Alice in Wonderland(1951)

The walrus smokes cigars, the dodo enjoys a pipe, and the caterpillar loves to puff on a hookah in the Disney classic.

Pinocchio (1940)

They were also almost 50% more likely to be a current smoker than those least exposed.

The UK Centre for Tobacco Control Studies has called on the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) and the Government to review their policies on film classification, arguing that under-18s need to be protected from potentially harmful imagery.

02-11-036_sundaytelegraph,2011-09-25,Stubbing out the celluloid cigarette,"Teenagers are more prone to take up smoking, a report found last week, if they watch films in which the characters smoke.

As a result, there have been calls to give films which depict smoking an 18 certificate.

This seems a tricky argument, not least because you'd have to reclassify nearly every film from the golden age of Hollywood cinema, in which nobody swears but everyone smokes their heads off.

As a child, I remember thinking that smoking was extremely cool, and duly posing in front of the mirror with candy cigarettes (the end thoughtfully daubed with a little cochineal faux-ember).

Corner shops sold cigarettes as singles, and people puffed away freely on buses and in cinemas: if you closed your eyes, you might have assumed that British air was naturally tobacco-flavoured.

The era came drifting back with every smoke-soaked frame of the new film of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, set in 1973.

We all know, now, that smoking is deeply harmful, but I suspect that - for certain young people - is part of its appeal.

And while the fiddly, transgressive ritual of lighting a cigarette was perfectly designed for flirting, when I see smoking on screen now a little voice tends to whisper ""emphysema, lung cancer, yellow nails and teeth"", rather than ""deeply sexy"".

Perhaps it is simply that, as you get older, self-destruction loses its appeal once you understand how very easily it can be accomplished.",,{},{},,
02-11-036_bbcnews,2011-09-20,Smoking in films 'encourages teenagers to take it up',"Teenagers who watch films showing actors smoking are more likely to take it up, new UK research suggests.

Experts who made the link by questioning 5,000 15-year-olds say their findings should prompt a change in film certification so that under-18s are no longer exposed to such images.

The Bristol University investigators say a precautionary approach is needed.

But pro-smoking choice campaigners say this is unjustified and nonsensical. 

They say there is no proof that what a person views at the cinema or on DVD influences their decision about whether or not to smoke. 

Social background 

The latest research, published in the journal Thorax, looked at the potential influence of some of the 360 top US box office films released between 2001 and 2005, including movies like Spider-Man, Bridget Jones and The Matrix, that depict smoking.

Adolescents who saw the most films depicting smoking were 73% more likely to have tried a cigarette than those exposed to the least.

And they were 50% more likely to be a current smoker. 

Knowing that smoking attitudes are influenced by factors such as whether an individual's parents and peers smoke, the researchers also gathered data about the adolescents' social background. 

Even after controlling for these variables, these teenagers were still 32% more likely to have tried a cigarette themselves, they said.

'Harmful imagery' 

Dr Andrea Waylen, who led the research, said: ""We saw a linear relationship between adolescent smoking and the number of films they had seen depicting smoking.

""More than half of the films shown in the UK that contain smoking are rated UK15 or below, so children and young teenagers are clearly exposed.""

She said raising certification to 18 was necessary in the UK and would lower youth smoking rates.

The UK Centre for Tobacco Control Studies has written to the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) asking it to do just this to protect children from ""particularly harmful imagery"".

Both U (universal) and PG (parental guidance) film ratings proscribe ""potentially dangerous behaviour which young children are likely to copy"".

This includes drug misuse but not cigarette smoking. 

David Cooke, director of the BBFC, said: ""Smoking is a major public health issue and we consulted the public very extensively on it in 2005 and 2009.

Their clear expectation is that we should be vigilant, sensible and proportionate in how we deal with the issue.

""Glamorising smoking has therefore been included as a classification issue in our published classification guidelines and we frequently use our extended classification information to draw the attention of parents and others to depictions of smoking in films. 

'Patronising' 

""There is, however, no public support for automatically classifying, for instance, a PG film at 18 just because it happens to contain a scene of smoking.

We always look carefully at all research on this and related subjects drawn to our attention. 

""Experience suggests, with media effects research generally, that attempts to claim a causal link between a particular depiction and a particular behaviour are often disputed and seldom conclusive.""

Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said: ""The idea that films need to be reclassified in order to create a utopian, smoke-free world for older children is not only patronising, it is completely unnecessary.

""Today you would be hard-pressed to find a leading character who smokes in any top 10 box office movie.

16-11-007_dailymail,2011-10-28,ASPIRIN EVERY DAY CAN CUT CANCER RISK,"TAKING aspirin regularly can cut the long-term risk of cancer, according to the first major study of its kind.

British researchers found it can reduce the risk by 60 per cent in people with a family history of the disease.

The landmark research covering 16 countries is the first proof that the painkiller has a preventive action that is likely to benefit anyone using it every day.

Millions who take low-dose aspirin to prevent heart disease will gain from its anti-cancer properties, while healthy people may follow the example of increasing numbers of doctors who take it for insurance.

In the study of 861 patients with Lynch syndrome, a genetic fault leading to bowel and other cancers at an early age, half were given two aspirins a day, 600 mg in total, for two years.

The remainder were given placebo, or dummy, pills, says a report published online in The Lancet medical journal.

Initially, the researchers found no change in cancer rates between the groups.

But when they followed up the study after five years, they detected a significant difference.

By 2010 a total of 19 new bowel cancers had been identified among those given aspirin and 34 among the placebo group Ð a cut of 44 per cent among those taking the drug.

When researchers focused on the 60 per cent of patients who they were certain had conscientiously taken aspirin for at least two years they found an even more striking result.

Just ten cancers were discovered in the aspirin group compared with 23 in the placebo group, a cut of 63 per cent.

Rates of other cancers linked to Lynch syndrome were almost halved by taking aspirin.

Professor Sir John Burn from Newcastle University, who led the research, said: 'What we have finally shown is that aspirin has a major preventive effect on cancer but it doesn't become apparent until years later.'

The study is being hailed as the last piece of the jigsaw after years spent trying to prove that aspirin has a direct effect in stopping tumours.

A big step forward came last year with a study which showed that low-dose aspirin cuts overall death rates by a third after five years' use.

However, it used records to look at the incidental benefits for patients taking it to stave off further heart attacks and strokes.

The latest trial actually set out to prove that cancer could be prevented in people taking it for no other reason.

Experts say healthy middle-Maged people who start taking aspirin around the age of 45 or 50 for 20 to 30 years could expect to reap the most benefit because cancer rates rise with age.

There is widespread concern that side-effects such as stomach bleeding and haemorrhagic stroke outweigh any advantage among healthy people.

Sir John, who takes aspirin every day, estimates there 30,000 people with Lynch syndrome in the UK who might benefit from aspirin treatment.

He said: 'If we put them all on two aspirins a day now, in the next 30 years or so we would prevent 10,000 cancers.

On the other hand, this would cause around 1,000 ulcers.

'If we can prevent 10,000 cancers in return for 1,000 ulcers and 100 strokes, in most people's minds that's a good deal, especially if you've grown up in a family with three, four, five, six people who have had cancer.

'On the other hand, if you're just in the general population and you don't have cancer in your family, then that's going to be a much finer balance.'

Further research will take place, he said, to discover the ideal dose of aspirin.

16-11-007_sun,2011-10-28,TWO ASPIRINS DAILY 'WILL BLOCK CANCER',"THOUSANDS of hereditary cancer cases could be prevented by taking two aspirins a day, a landmark UK study has shown.

The dose cut the risk of bowel cancer in people with a family history of the disease by 63 PER CENT.

The finding could prevent 10,000 cancers over the next 30 years - saving 1,000 lives.

And it provides the strongest evidence yet of aspirin's anti-cancer properties.

The research concentrated on those with Lynch syndrome - a genetic fault suffered by one in 1,000 people.

It makes them ten times more likely to develop bowel cancer or, less commonly, womb and other organ tumours.

Between 1999 and 2005, nearly 900 sufferers were put on a treatment of either aspirin or a dummy pill. Initial analysis of results were unremarkable.

But in the years that followed, it emerged the aspirin was having a delayed impact.

Among those taking it, ten had developed cancer - compared with 23 in the placebo group.

The study's lead scientist, Newcastle University's Professor Sir John Burn, said: ""If we were to put all Lynch syndrome sufferers on two aspirins a day now, in 30 years we would prevent 10,000 cancers.""

But Sir John admitted side-effects could be a problem. He said: ""The aspirin would cause around 1,000 ulcers, so there's a tradeoff.

If you could get by on a smaller dose you could potentially prevent many ulcers.""

Fellow researcher Prof Patrick Morrison, of Belfast's Queen's University, added: ""This is a huge breakthrough for those with a family history of hereditary cancers, such as bowel or womb cancer.

""For anyone considering taking aspirin I would recommend discussing this with their GP first as aspirin brings with it a risk of ulcers.""

Cancer Research UK's bowel cancer expert Prof Chris Paraskeva said: ""This adds to the growing body of evidence showing the importance of aspirin in the cancer fight.""

16-11-007_mirror,2011-10-28,TWO ASPIRIN A DAY PREVENTS CANCER; SCIENTISTS' TESTS FIND PILLS CUT RISK BY 63%,"TAKING aspirin every day can cut the risk of colon cancer by more than 60%, a 10-year trial has found.

Scientists now claim the case is proved for giving aspirin to patients at risk from a family history of colon cancers.

The worldwide trial compared people who took two aspirin a day with those who took a placebo pill.

The study, published by The Lancet, involved 43 centres in 16 countries and followed nearly 1,000 patients.

All patients were carriers of Lynch syndrome, a genetic condition that programmes a person to developing colorectal cancer and a range of other solid-organ cancers.

At least one in 1,000 carries the disorder which accounts for about one in 30 cases of bowel cancer.

First results in 2007 showed no significant effects from taking aspirin.

In a follow-up in 2010 of the 861 patients, it was found 19 of those who took aspirin at various times between 1999 and 2005 had developed colon cancers, compared to 34 who took the placebo - a 44% reduction.

But in those who took aspirin every day for two years the results were even more dramatic - a 63% reduction in cancer.

There were only 10 bowel cancer cases in the aspirin group, compared with 23 in the placebo group.

Lead scientist Prof Sir John Burn, of Newcastle University, said: ""We set out to find out if aspirin prevents cancer and we have found that it does.

There could be 30,000 people with Lynch syndrome in the UK who might benefit from aspirin treatment.""

However, he said that sufferers should consult first with their GP.

He said: ""Aspirin is known to bring with it a risk of stomach complaints, including ulcers.

However, if there is a strong family history of cancer then people may want to weigh up the cost-benefits.

""If you give two aspirin a day for two years to people with hereditary bowel cancer then after five years their risk is cut by more than half.

""If we were to put them all on two aspirin a day now, in the next 30 years or so we would prevent 10,000 cancers.

On the other hand, this would cause around 1,000 ulcers, so there's a trade-off.""

Science minister David Willetts said: ""This has potential to save thousands of lives.""

WONDER DRUG

40,000 tons of aspirin is consumed globally each year.

16-11-007_express,2011-10-28,ASPIRIN SLASHES RISK OF CANCER; Daily aspirin helps in the fight against bowel cancer,"A DAILY dose of aspirin can slash the risk of developing bowel cancer by 60 per cent.

A ground-breaking trial has proved that taking two of the ""wonder"" pills a day gives long-term protection and could save thousands of lives each year.

Lead researcher Professor Sir John Burn, of the University of Newcastle, said: ""We have finally shown that aspirin has a major preventative effect on cancer, but this doesn't become apparent until years later.

""If you gave two aspirin a day for two years to people with hereditary bowel cancer, after five years their cancer risk will be reduced by more than half.""

The landmark British study was hailed by Professor Nick Hastie, director of the Medical Research Council Human Genetics Unit, as providing ""the clearest evidence yet"" that aspirin can protect against cancer.

He said: ""As we learn more about the underlying mechanism of this effect, we will eventually be able to develop new ways of preventing and treating cancer.""

The study was carried out in patients at high risk of bowel cancer but experts hope the findings could have wider implications in the general population.

There was also evidence of a similar impact on cancers with the same genetic link - womb, ovarian, pancreatic, brain, stomach and kidney.

Further research is to be carried out, but the researchers said people with a family history of bowel cancer may want to start taking a low dose of aspirin as a preventative measure after first discussing it with their doctor.

The study, called CAPP2 and published online in The Lancet, provides the most definitive evidence yet of aspirin's anti-cancer properties.

Strongly

It focused on patients with Lynch syndrome, a genetic fault that strongly predisposes people to bowel cancer.

Around one in 1,000 of the population carry the genes, which account for one in 30 cases of bowel cancer.

Those affected are 10 times more likely than average to develop cancer.

Each year around 40,000 people in Britain are diagnosed with bowel cancer and more than 16,000 die from it.

The findings suggest aspirin treatment could prevent up to 10,000 cancers over the next 30 years and possibly save 1,000 lives.

Despite taking large doses of aspirin - two 300 milligram pills per day - patients suffered no adverse effects.

Aspirin is known to raise the risk of strokes, internal bleeding and stomach ulcers, so there is a trade-off.

It is given to people at risk of heart attacks or stroke.

As a long-term anticoagulant or a preventative measure for heart disease, the dose is 75mg a day.

As a painkiller, the recommended dose is 275 to 300mg, not exceeding three doses a day.

A new investigation will look at the dose needed to prevent cancer.

The CAPP2 study between 1999 and 2005 involved 861 people identified as Lynch syndrome carriers and given aspirin or a placebo.

Results in 2007 showed no difference in bowel cancer rates.

But by 2010 there was a 44 per cent reduced incidence rate linked to the aspirins.

Further analysis of the 60 per cent who took aspirin for at least two years revealed a 63 per cent difference.

Professor Chris Paraskeva, Cancer Research UK's bowel cancer expert, said: ""This adds to the growing body of evidence showing the importance of aspirin in the fight against cancer.""

Mark Flannagan, chief executive of Beating Bowel Cancer, said: ""These results are really very promising.""

NHS' MUST BE READAY AS CASES DOUBLE

THE number of cancer cases in Britain is set to almost double over the next 20 years.

Experts warn that the NHS ""faces a perfect storm"" and must start preparing now.

New cases are set to leap 45 per cent to around 432,000 by 2030, according to Cancer Research UK in a study published in the British Journal of Cancer.

The main reason for a 55 per cent rise in male cancer and a 35 per cent increase for women is that people are living longer.

The biggest projected increase is in the most dangerous form of skin cancer - malignant melanoma - at 52 per cent.

Male kidney cancer is estimated to rise by 28 per cent, followed by liver cancer (27 per cent) and oral cancer (25 per cent).

But breast cancer could fall seven per cent, due to a reduction in the use of HRT.

16-11-007_times,2011-10-28,"Aspirin can cut bowel cancer risk by half, study says","Tens of thousands of people at risk of bowel cancer should start taking aspirin daily, scientists say.

Aspirin cuts the chances of developing bowel cancer by more than half in people with a family history of the disease, a study has concluded.

The ""ground-breaking"" research is the first designed to demonstrate the protective effects of aspirin against cancer and will add weight to the idea that millions of middle-aged people should start taking a daily dose.

""We've now got the cherry on the cake - the randomised controlled trial that sets out to try to prove that [aspirin prevents cancer] and did so,"" said Professor Sir John Burn, of Newcastle University, who led the study.

His team looked at 861 people with Lynch syndrome, an inherited predisposition to cancer that affects more than 30,000 people in Britain.

Even though aspirin can cause internal bleeding, Sir John said that the case for such people to start taking it was ""overwhelmingly strong"".

""If you give them all aspirin, you prevent 10,000 cancers but cause 1,000 ulcers,"" he said.

""That's a good deal.""

A large study last year concluded that a daily dose of just 75mg of aspirin could cut death rates for all cancers by a third, using data from trials designed to look at low-dose aspirin's protective effect against heart attacks and strokes.

Sir John's team gave patients 600mg of aspirin a day, which they believed was likely to show a bigger effect in preventing cancer.

He is now starting a trial to determine the ideal daily dose.

Sir John said that he was already taking aspirin, which was likely to be most effective if taken from a patient's late forties or fifties.

""Before anyone begins to take aspirin on a regular basis they should consult their doctor as aspirin is known to bring with it a risk of stomach complaints, including ulcers,"" he said.

""However, if there is a strong family history of cancer then people may want to weigh up the cost benefits, particularly as these days drugs which block acid production in the stomach are available over the counter.""

Half of the 861 people in the study took two aspirin (600mg) a day, for varying lengths of time.

Ten years after they began taking the pills, there had been 19 cancers among people who had taken aspirin, and 34 among those taking a placebo.

Among those who took the drug for at least two years, there were ten cancers in the aspirin group and 23 in the placebo group.

The effect began to be seen five years after they started taking aspirin and persisted well after they stopped, researchers report in The Lancet.

""What we have finally shown is that aspirin has a major preventative effect on cancer but this does not become apparent until years later,"" Sir John said.

""If you give two aspirin a day for two years to people [at risk of] hereditary bowel cancer, after five years their cancer risk will be reduced by more than half.""

Each year around 40,000 people in Britain are found to have bowel cancer and more than 16,000 die from the disease.

How exactly aspirin prevents cancer is unclear, but Sir John believes that compounds found in the drug trigger genetically damaged cells to destroy themselves at a very early stage.

David Willetts, the Science Minister, said: ""This ground-breaking study is an excellent achievement for the UK research base and a welcome addition to our robust body of evidence on cancer.

It has the potential to save thousands of lives worldwide.""

The study shows that regularly taking the medicine cuts the risk of bowel cancer by more than 60% in those with a particular genetic predisposition to get the disease - as well as reducing the risk of other hereditary cancers.

Scientists who led the study said people with several family members with cancers other than breast, blood and prostate might be advised to start taking aspirin daily from the age of 45.

They said those without a family history of the disease might also consider doing so, but that they should make a personal assessment of the risks and benefits and get medical advice.

Anyone thinking of taking the drug regularly should consult their doctor first.

Doctors already prescribe low, daily doses of aspirin to people at increased risk of heart attacks and strokes, and evidence has been growing of anti-cancer properties for 20 years.

However, this is the first long-term, randomised controlled trial to show such an effect.

The trial involved people with Lynch syndrome, a genetic abnormality that predisposes carriers to develop bowel cancer and other solid organ cancers including endometrial, ovarian, stomach, kidney, oesophageal, brain and skin tumours.

The condition affects at least one in 1,000 people.

Carriers are around 10 times as likely to develop cancer and often do so at a young age.

Professor John Burn of Newcastle University, who led the study, estimated that if all 30,000 or so people with Lynch syndrome in the UK were to start taking two aspirin tablets a day then some 10,000 cancers would be prevented over the next 30 years, saving about a thousand lives.

The downside of the treatment is that around an extra thousand people would develop stomach ulcers as a side-effect.

""People with a genetic susceptibility are a model system,"" said Burn, whose work is published today in the Lancet online.

""They are more sensitive to the environmental triggers to cancer.

""If we can do something to change cancer progression in people at high genetic risk, then that's telling us what we might all benefit.

But we are not making a recommendation for the general population.

Everyone can take this evidence and make their own choice.""

Between 1999 and 2005, about half of a group of 861 Lynch syndrome carriers were given two aspirins (600mg) a day, while the rest took placebos.

By 2010 those who had taken aspirin for at least two years were 63% less likely to have developed bowel cancer.

Looking at all forms of the disease, almost 30% of those in the placebo group developed a Lynch syndrome-related cancer, compared with 15% for those given aspirin.

The most common side effects associated with taking aspirin are gastrointestinal ulcers and stomach bleeding.

There is also an very small increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke.

There was no difference in the proportions of the study groups suffering such side-effects.

Burn added that he takes low-dose aspirin tablets as a preventative measure.

""That was a balanced judgment based on weighing risks and benefits.""

Scientists have described the results, published in The Lancet, as ""the icing on the cake"" after more than two decades of research into aspirin's effect on cancer. 

Today's study specifically looks at the preventative effect in those with a hereditary condition called Lynch Syndrome, thought to affect about 60,000 people in Britain.

Despite being present in only one in 1,000 people, it is responsible for one in 30 bowel cancers. 

But the researchers said the study added powerful new evidence that aspirin protected against bowel cancer in the wider population too. 

Bowel cancer is the third most common cancer in Britain, with 40,000 new cases annually and over 16,000 deaths. 

The study of 861 middle-aged people with Lynch Syndrome found those who took two 300mg pills daily for two years, were 63 per cent less likely to have developed bowel cancer five years later, than those given a placebo. 

The results are critical for those with the syndrome because their lifetime risk of developing bowel cancer is as high as one in two. 

Professor Sir John Burn from Newcastle University, who led the international project, said he and colleagues were ""very pleased"" with the ""impressive"" results. 

He and Professor Tim Bishop, of Leeds University, suggested those with Lynch Syndrome should start taking aspirin from the age of 20, as they can develop cancers well before middle age. 

They estimated that, excluding the young and the very old, about 30,000 of them should be taking aspirin. 

Prof Burn said: ""If we were to put them on aspirin now, we would stop about 10,000 cancers over 30 years.""

However, only about 10 per cent of those with Lynch Syndrome know they have it. 

The results follow a landmark study led by Professor Peter Rothwell of Oxford University, published a year ago. 

It found people taking low dose (75mg) aspirin daily for five years were 25 per cent less likely to have developed bowel cancer after 20 years than those not taking it. 

The participants had been taking the drug to prevent heart disease and stroke.

They were drawn from the general population, not just those with Lynch Syndrome. 

Prof Rothwell consequently suggested everybody should consider taking low dose aspirin daily from the age of 45, although he said it was a matter for individuals to decide ""rather than us making definitive statements"". 

Professors Burn and Bishop echoed that advice.

They have already advised their patients and volunteers with Lynch Syndrome to take aspirin, and said others needed to consider the ""sliding scale"" of aspirin's benefits and risks depending on their circumstances. 

The drug is known to increase slightly the chance of stomach and intestinal ulcers, particularly in the elderly. 

While Prof Rothwell's work convinced many that aspirin helped prevent cancer, because it was an observational study it could not prove cause and effect. 

Today's study was different, said Prof Burn, being ""the first randomised controlled trial [of aspirin] undertaken with cancer as an end point"". 

The group now aims to determine the best dose for those with Lynch Syndrome and wants to recruit 3,000 people around the world to do so.

They will be given either 600, 300, or 75mg daily. 

David Willetts, the Universities and Science Minister, welcomed the ""groundbreaking study"" as ""an excellent achievement for the UK research base"". 

He said: ""It has the potential to save thousands of lives worldwide and is clear evidence of the value of long-term studies showing simple steps that can be taken to improve people's lives.""

16-11-007_bbcnews,2011-10-28,Daily aspirin 'blocks bowel cancer',"A daily dose of aspirin should be given to people at high risk of bowel cancer, say scientists. 

Two pills a day for two years reduced the incidence of bowel cancer by 63% in a group of 861 at-risk patients, a study reported in The Lancet said. 

Newcastle University's Prof Sir John Burn, who led the study, said the evidence ""seems overwhelmingly strong"".

Other experts said the findings added to a growing body of proof that aspirin could be used in the fight with cancer.

The study was conducted on 861 patients with Lynch syndrome, which affects one in every 1,000 people.

They struggle to detect and repair damaged DNA which means they are more likely to develop a range of cancers including those of the bowel, womb and stomach.

'Good deal' 

When looking at all patients in the trial, those in the group given 600 milligrams of aspirin every day developed 19 tumours compared to 34 tumours in the other ""control"" group, a reduction of 44%. 

When the researchers looked at just those patients who took the medication for at least two years the reduction was 63%.

There was also an effect on other cancers linked to Lynch syndrome, which fell by half in the treatment group.

Prof Sir John Burn, from Newcastle University, said there were 30,000 adults in the UK with Lynch syndrome. 

If all were given the treatment he said it would prevent 10,000 cancers over 30 years and he speculated that this could possibly prevent 1,000 deaths from the disease.

However, there would also be side effects.

""If we can prevent 10,000 cancers in return for 1,000 ulcers and 100 strokes, in most people's minds that's a good deal,"" he said.

""People who've got a clear family history of, particularly, bowel cancer should seriously consider adding low dose aspirin to their routine and particularly those people who've got a genetic predisposition.""

Aspirin is already well known to reduce the risk of heart attack and haemorrhagic stroke in high risk patients. 

Other studies over the past two decades have suggested the pain killer reduced cancer risk, but this was the first randomised control trial, specifically for aspirin in cancer, to prove it.

In 2010, a study suggested patients given aspirin had a 25% lower risk of death during that trial.

Prof Peter Rothwell, from Oxford University, who conducted that study said the latest research ""certainly helps to build a consistent picture, all pointing in the same direction that there is a link with cancer"".

Cancer Research UK's Prof Chris Paraskeva said: ""This adds to the growing body of evidence showing the importance of aspirin, and aspirin-like drugs, in the fight against cancer.""

'Balanced argument' 

One of the questions asked by the research into aspirin was whether healthy people with no family risks should take the drug.

The lower the risk of heart attack or cancer, the lower the benefit of taking aspirin, yet there are still potentially deadly side effects. 

Sir John said that it was a ""finely balanced argument"" and that he decided the risks were worth it for him. 

""I think where we're headed for is people that are in their 50s and 60s would look very seriously at adding a low dose aspirin to their daily routine because it's giving protection against cancer, heart attack and stroke.

""But if they do that they've got to have their eyes wide open.

16-11-007_reuters,2011-10-28,Aspirin slashes hereditary cancer risk in study,"Taking two aspirin a day for two years reduces the long-term risk of bowel cancer in people with a family history of the disease by around 60 percent, according to a British study published on Friday.

The finding could also have implications for the wider population, though more research is needed to determine an ideal dose for different groups of people.

In recent years there has been an intense debate about the merits of routinely taking aspirin, which increases the risk of stomach ulcers and internal bleeding, but also protects against heart problems.

John Burn of Newcastle University believes his study -- the first randomised controlled trial into the effect of aspirin on cancer outcomes -- is a key piece of evidence validating the case for aspirin.

Previous research into cancer and aspirin, a cheap drug originally developed by Bayer more than a century ago, has been based on less robust observational studies.

Burn's study looked at people with Lynch syndrome, a genetic condition predisposing them to a range of cancers.

It affects at least one in 1,000 people and around half of them develop cancer, mainly in the bowel and womb.

His data suggests that for every 10,000 cancers prevented, there could be 1,000 extra ulcers due to aspirin.

""There's a trade-off. If we could get by on a smaller dose, then we could potentially avoid a lot of those ulcers,"" Burn told a news conference.

For the general population, taking low-dose aspirin might be a more sensible option, and a major new multi-dose trial should shed more light on this in the next few years, he added.

DELAYED EFFECT

Burn and colleagues studied 861 people with Lynch syndrome, who began a two-year course of either 600 milligrams a day of aspirin or a placebo between 1999 and 2005.

An initial analysis in 2007 found no difference in cancer rates between the groups.

But it turned out the effect was delayed and in 2010 there was a clear divergence, with 19 new bowel cancers among those on aspirin and 34 in the placebo arm.

What is more, among those patients who stuck to the full two-year regimen of pill-taking -- some 60 percent of the total -- the effects were more pronounced, and strongly statistically significant, with a 63 percent reduction in bowel cancer cases from 23 in the placebo group versus 10 in the aspirin group.

""What we have finally shown is that aspirin has a major preventative effect on cancer but this doesn't become apparent until years later,"" Burn said.

How exactly aspirin provides protection is unclear, but Burn said the delayed effect suggested aspirin may hit faulty stem cells before they mutate into pre-cancerous cells.

The study, which was published online by the Lancet medical journal and part-funded by Bayer, also found some evidence of a reduction in other solid cancers linked to Lynch syndrome.

""This is a really important study showing that aspirin can significantly reduce the risk of bowel and other cancers in patients genetically at high risk of developing cancer,"" said Chris Paraskeva of the University of Bristol, who was not involved in the research.

In a commentary in the Lancet, Andrew Chan of Harvard Medical and Scott Lippman of the MD Anderson Cancer Centre in Houston said the findings were ""compelling"" and arguably supported more general recommendations to consider aspirin for preventing bowel cancer, based on individual patients' risks.","{""Lancet"": 1}","{""John Burn"": 1, ""Burn"": 5, ""Lynch"": 3, ""Chris Paraskeva"": 1, ""Andrew Chan"": 1, ""Scott Lippman"": 1}","{""Newcastle University"": 1, ""Bayer"": 2, ""Lancet"": 2, ""the University of Bristol"": 1, ""Harvard Medical"": 1, ""the MD Anderson Cancer Centre"": 1}","{""Burn"": 2, ""Lynch"": 1, ""Andrew Chan"": 1, ""Scott Lippman"": 1}","{""Newcastle University"": 1, ""Bayer"": 2, ""Lancet"": 2, ""the University of Bristol"": 1, ""Harvard Medical"": 1, ""the MD Anderson Cancer Centre"": 1}"

Almost three-quarters of eight-month-old babies consume too much salt because they are fed too much processed food, cow's milk and bread, according to a report.

Processed food including tinned pasta, salty flavourings such as gravies and yeast extract are among the foodstuffs blamed by the Univeristy of Bristol researchers.

The nutritionists who carried out the study warned that high levels of salt consumed at a very young age can harm developing kidneys, give children a taste for salty foods and lead to poor habits that can persist into adult life.

 High blood pressure established in childhood can track through to adulthood, the report says.

It adds that it is ""extremely important"" that mothers receive clear and precise information over ""appropriate foods"" when they are weaning children.

Many parents are ""unaware"" of the amount of salt in manufactured foods and those of ""low socio-economic status"" tend to be less well informed about ""suitable"" foods.

The research is part of a long-term ongoing study of parents and youngsters called Children of the Nineties. 

Though the raw research was done in the early 90s, the authors say it remains relevant and they would expect the results to be similar if it was carried out now.

According to the research, most infants were first introduced to solids when they were between three and four months old.

 The government's scientific advisory committee on nutrition advises that infants aged between seven and 12 months receive no more than 1g of salt a day.

The Bristol study found that 70% were receiving more than the recommended amount and some were consuming double the level recommended.

Those consuming most salt tended to be taking cow's milk as a main drink - which is not recommended for children under 12 months old - and to be eating bread. Salty flavourings, canned pasta, yeast extract and baked beans were other ingredients and food the researchers were concerned about.

Pauline Emmett and Vicky Cribb, the nutritionists who conducted the research, said: ""These findings show salt intakes need to be substantially reduced in children of this age group.

""Infants need foods specifically prepared for them without added salt, so it is important to adapt the family diet. 

This research suggests that clear advice is needed for parents about what foods are suitable for infants.

""This should be given to all parents and carers, and should include the important advice not to use cows' milk as a main drink before 12 months of age.""

The researchers said progress had been made since the data was collected, with more manufacturers reducing the salt content of foods. 

But they said more needed to be done.

""Given that three-quarters of salt in the diet comes from processed adult foods, successful salt-reduction strategies can only be achieved with the co-operation of the food industry.

""Manufacturers have a responsibility to reduce the salt content of food products. This process has already started in UK but much more needs to be done.

""That is the hallmark of cocaine dependence - namely, that most of them are intelligent people who go to great extents to buy cocaine, to get more cocaine, to put their jobs at risk, their families at risk,"" said Ersche.

The results were published in the journal Brain. Ersche and her team scanned the brains of 60 people who were dependent on cocaine and compared them with scans of 60 people without any history of drug-taking. ""We found significant abnormalities in the brains of the cocaine users,"" she said.

Specifically, the amount of grey matter in the orbitofrontal cortex was reduced in people with cocaine addiction, an area involved in decision-making and goal-directed behaviour.

Other affected areas included the insula, an area of the brain involved in feedback processing, learning and feelings of cravings. The grey matter in the anterior cingulate, involved in emotional processing and being attentive, was also reduced.

In contrast, a region deep in the brain associated with reward processing, attention and motor movements - the chordate nucleus - was enlarged in subjects who were addicted to the drug. This could explain why those subjects were more prone to addiction but the scientists cannot be sure whether the enlargement is a result of cocaine use.

Ersche said her research was not conclusive on which came first. ""At the moment, correlation shows me a direct relationship, but I don't know which direction the relationship is.""

But the work could be used to help in diagnosis and treatment of addiction.

""We basically show that cocaine is a disorder of the brain, which is a big step,"" said Ersche.","{""Brain"": 1}","{""Karen Ersche"": 1, ""Ersche"": 4}","{""the Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute"": 1, ""the University of Cambridge"": 1}","{""Karen Ersche"": 1, ""Ersche"": 3}","{""the Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute"": 1, ""the University of Cambridge"": 1}"

15-11-026_reuters,2011-05-18,Cell therapy aims to prevent transplant rejection,"A cell treatment to prevent new organs being rejected without the need for lifelong courses of immune drugs is showing promise in mice and may one day make human transplants easier, scientists said.

The process, if developed for humans, would see transplant patients being injected with their own immune cells after they have first been removed and ""taught"" in a lab not to reject new tissue, the scientists said on Wednesday.

""We have developed a new approach to generate cells called regulatory T cells (T-regs) that can control rejection of transplanted tissue in mice,"" said Andrew Bushell of Britain's Oxford University, whose study was published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

For many patients, an organ transplant opens up a new life, but it also means taking drugs called immunosuppressants -- which have a wide-range of side effects -- for the rest of their lives to make sure the organ is not rejected. 

Novartis's (NOVN.VX) Neoral, Myfortic and Sandimmune, Roche's (ROG.VX) Cellcept, Pfizer's (PFE.N) Rapamune and Prograf from Astellas Pharma (4503.T) are among leading branded drugs given to prevent transplanted organ rejection.

""Many research groups across the world are trying to solve this problem because developing better ways to prevent transplant rejection is a big unmet clinical need. Regulatory T cells may provide part of the answer,"" said Bushell.

The Oxford team, with colleagues from other British universities and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, developed their technique by harvesting human T cells and culturing them in a lab dish with a drug called cilostamide as well as cells from the tissue being transplanted.

The scientists found cilostamide, a generic drug already widely used in people with vascular problems, blocks a biological pathway and encourages the growth of T-reg cells.

By culturing the immune cells with others from the donated tissue, the T-regs are taught to recognise the donor tissue and turn off rejection.

Researchers then showed that human regulatory T cells produced in this way could also control transplant rejection in an experimental mouse bred to have a human-like immune system.

The research was among three studies in this week's Science Translational Medicine reporting progress towards potential immune cell treatments to prevent transplant rejection. 

Scientists say future steps would involving trying the cell therapy approach first in a so-called living donor transplant, where a person donates an organ to a relative or friend.

A blood sample would be taken from the patient a few weeks before the operation so that the T-regs could be grown and tested in the laboratory before being given back. 

The transplant would then be carried out and immunosuppressants given to control early rejection. But as the patient's own T-reg cells begin to control rejection, the drugs could be gradually withdrawn until they were no longer needed.

""If the techniques used in these studies can be transferred to the clinic it could signal a move to replace long term use of immune-suppressing drugs.

This would be a huge step forward for transplantation,"" said Shannon Amoils of the British Heart Foundation charity which helped fund the research.

They are much more effective than carbohydrates found in the chocolates, biscuits and sweets often relied on for a quick energy boost.

Cambridge University researchers looked at how nutrients affect the brain cells that keeping us awake and burning calories.

A mixture similar to the protein content of egg whites activated these cells, triggering the release of the stimulant orexin.

Sugar, however, blocked the release of orexin.

Researcher Dr Denis Burdakov said: 'What is exciting is to have a rational way to ""tune"" select brain cells to be more or less active by deciding what food to eat.

'Research suggests that if you have a choice between jam on toast, or egg whites on toast, go for the latter.Ê

'Even though the two may contain the same number of calories, having a bit of protein will tell the body to burn more calories out of those consumed.'

The findings were published in the journal Neuron.

The slogan 'Go to work on an egg' was used in a 1960s advertising campaign by the Egg Marketing Board.

Lead researcher Dr Denis Burdakov, said: ""Electrical impulses emitted by orexin cells stimulate wakefulness and tell the body to burn calories.

""We wondered whether dietary nutrients altered those impulses.

""Glucose actually blocks orexin cells, which may be why we sometimes feel sleepy after eating.""

A wearable 'artificial pancreas' could dramatically reduce the risks of pregnancy in women with insulin-dependent diabetes, research has shown.

In tests, the device was shown to help keep blood sugar levels under control and prevent the potentially fatal complications that can affect diabetic mothers-to-be.

Babies of women with the condition have a five-fold increased risk of being stillborn and are three times more likely than average to die in their first months of life.

They also have double the normal risk of a major deformity. In addition, low blood glucose is a leading cause of death among pregnant mothers.

Two out of every three mothers who suffered from diabetes before getting pregnant have the type 1 disease, which affects around 300,000 people in the UK.

Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the condition, is lifestyle-related and tends to affect older people past their reproductive age.

The artificial pancreas, a mobile phone-sized device worn on the hip, consists of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and an insulin pump.

The device automatically monitors blood glucose and pumps insulin into the circulation to maintain correct sugar levels.

Previous studies showed the system could help children with type 1 diabetes, but until now it had not been successfully tested on pregnant women.

Helen Murphy, from Cambridge University, who led the study funded by Diabetes UK, said: 'For women with type 1 diabetes, self-management is particularly challenging during pregnancy due to physiological and hormonal changes.

'Previous studies indicate that pregnant women with the condition spend an average of 10 hours a day with glucose levels outside the recommended target.

'These high blood glucose levels increase the risk of congenital malformation, stillbirth, neonatal death, pre-term delivery, macrosomia (oversized babies) and neonatal admission. 

'So to discover an artificial pancreas can help maintain near-normal glucose levels in these women is very promising.'

Iain Frame, director of research at Diabetes UK, said: 'Although early days, this exciting area of research, funded by our donors, has huge potential to make pregnancy much safer for women with type 1 diabetes, and their babies.

'It's a fantastic example of how existing technologies, in this case, insulin pumps and CGMs, can be adapted and developed to benefit as many people with diabetes as possible. 

'We now need to see an extension of this study, one which tests larger numbers of women, and then take it out of the hospital and into the home setting.'

The device, which is worn on the side of the body, helps to keep blood sugar levels under control and prevent the potentially fatal complications that can affect women with insulin-dependent diabetes during their pregnancy.

The discovery was welcomed by health campaigners and patients, many of whom take great risks in deciding to have a baby, knowing the problems their diabetes could cause.

Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune disease which stops the pancreas producing insulin, meaning that patients have to take regular doses of the hormone to control their sugar levels.

The babies of women with the condition have a fivefold increased risk of being stillborn and are three times more likely than average to die in their first months of life.

These babies also have double the normal risk of a major deformity, while low blood glucose is a leading cause of death among pregnant mothers.

In a effort to address this problem, researchers at Cambridge University wanted to create a device that would act as a pancreas during a pregnancy, when controlling their condition is even more vital.

The artificial pancreas that they came up with is a mobile phone-sized device which is worn on the hip.

The device consists of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), to measure blood sugar levels, and an insulin pump.

03-11-001_bbcnews,2011-01-31,Artificial pancreas could save lives during pregnancy,"An artificial pancreas given to pregnant women with diabetes could save mothers' lives and improve the health of their babies, researchers say.

Hormonal changes during pregnancy coupled with diabetes make regulating sugar levels difficult, which can have damaging consequences.

The Diabetes Care research shows an artificial pancreas can keep sugar at normal levels.

Diabetes UK, which funded the work, said it could make pregnancy safer.

Pregnancy worries 

People with Type 1 diabetes are unable to control their blood sugar levels because their pancreas stops producing insulin. 

It is a fatal condition which can be controlled by regular insulin injections, but that becomes much more complicated during pregnancy.

The safe range for blood sugar levels is much narrower then, and high or low levels which would be fine for an adult can damage a baby.

 “To discover an artificial pancreas can help maintain near-normal glucose levels in these women is very promising” - Dr Helen Murphy Cambridge University 

Dr Helen Murphy, from Cambridge University, told the BBC: ""Half of all babies born to mothers with Type 1 diabetes are overweight or obese at birth because of too much sugar in the blood"".

An earlier study of pregnant women in England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed the rate of stillbirths and deaths in the first week was four times greater in women with Type 1 diabetes, affecting 32 out of every 1,000 pregnancies.

Pregnancy can also be dangerous for the mother, who can end up with lower blood sugar levels and sometimes lose the warning signs for potentially fatal hypoglycaemic attacks. 

During pregnancy, women with Type 1 diabetes spend 10 hours every day with sugar levels outside those recommended.

Artificial Pancreas 

Researchers at the Medical Research Laboratories in Cambridge fitted artificial pancreases to 10 women with the disease.

A sensor continually monitored sugar levels, which fed the information to a computer, which then told an insulin pump how much of the hormone to inject.

The early study showed that normal sugar levels could be maintained.

Dr Helen Murphy, from Cambridge University, said: ""For women with Type 1 diabetes, self-management is particularly challenging during pregnancy due to physiological and hormonal changes. 

""These high blood glucose levels increase the risk of congenital malformation, stillbirth, neonatal death, preterm delivery, macrosomia [oversized babies] and neonatal admission. So to discover an artificial pancreas can help maintain near-normal glucose levels in these women is very promising"".

However she said it would probably require care before pregnancy to reduce the number of stillbirths and neonatal deaths.

07-11-002_dailymail,2011-02-04,Women in Britain are the fattest in Western Europe... but still not as big as the Americans,"British women are the most overweight in Western Europe, figures have revealed.

Despite the unwelcome honour, however, they are still not as big as their U.S. counterparts. 

Meanwhile, men in the UK have the joint fourth highest fat levels, behind Ireland in top place, Spain and Andorra. 

Latest data on global trends in obesity reveal that weight rose rapidly in Britain between 1980 and 2008.

Researchers compiled body mass index (BMI) scores – which relate weight to height – for high and low income nations worldwide.

Under World Health Organisation guidelines, a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered ‘healthy’, 25 to 29.9 is overweight and 30 or above is clinically obese.

In 2008, the average BMI of British women was 26.9, up from 24.2 in 1980. 

The figure was the highest of 19 western European countries in the research. 

Among the rest of the world, other high-scoring countries included Russia (27.2), Israel (27.3) and Malta (27).

For British men, the average BMI was 27.4, matched by Cyprus and Luxembourg in Western Europe. 

This was up from 24.7 in 1980.

The U.S. had the highest BMI for men and women among high-income countries, with average scores of more than 28. 

Altogether, findings from three global studies looking at BMI, cholesterol and blood pressure over the past 28 years were published in The Lancet medical journal. 

The results showed that in 2008 more than one in ten of the world’s adult population – around half a billion – was obese, with women more likely to fall into the category than men. 

The total is nearly double the level recorded in 1980. 

A growing and ageing population also meant the number of people with uncontrolled high blood pressure rose from 600million in 1980 to nearly a billion in 2008. 

Although average levels of blood cholesterol fell in Western countries, they increased in Asia and the Pacific region.

Professor Majid Ezzati, of Imperial College London, said blood pressure and cholesterol control in the UK were good. 

‘But this is only managing the underlying problem, not providing solutions to the root cause, which is growing levels of obesity in the UK,’ he said. 

‘There is also the rising incidence of diabetes to consider.’

Dr Mike Knapton, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘It’s an ugly, upward trend but it can be reversed with effective policies and sensible lifestyle changes, supported by important developments in medicines.’

Dr David Haslam, of the National Obesity Forum, warned that modern lifestyles were fuelling the problem.

‘We’re all living in environments that encourage weight gain, and blood pressure and cholesterol levels start to rise with even small amounts of weight increase,’ he said.","{""Lancet medical journal"": 1}","{""Majid Ezzati"": 1, ""Mike Knapton"": 1, ""David Haslam"": 1}","{""World Health Organisation"": 1, ""BMI"": 1, ""Lancet"": 1, ""Imperial College London"": 1, ""the British Heart Foundation"": 1, ""the National Obesity Forum"": 1}",,"{""Imperial College London"": 1, ""the British Heart Foundation"": 1, ""the National Obesity Forum"": 1}"

The shock statistic emerged as our women were revealed to be the fattest in any major nation across western Europe. 

The average British female has ballooned since 1980. Experts have blamed ready meals, takeaways and driving instead of walking. 



Average body mass index, a fat measurement based on height and weight, is 26.9. 

This is classed as seriously overweight and well above women in Italy, France and Greece who have BMIs of around 24. 

Only tiny Malta (27) has a higher level in western Europe — while Turkish women (28.2) are the fattest in the entire continent. 

Thirty years ago, average Miss Britain had a BMI of 24.2. 

The study found one in ten adults worldwide is obese, double the 1980 figure. 

Britain’s fattest woman Sharon Mevsimler weighed 45st at her peak in Chelmsford, Essex. 

She died aged 41 last year.

BRITISH women are almost the fattest in western Europe.","The average woman is now classed as overweight with a body mass index of 26.9.

Most of our svelte European counterparts stay within the normal range – the BMI of Swiss women is 24.1, French women’s is 24.8 and Greek women’s 24.9.

The only European women who are bigger than us, according to a study yesterday, are from Malta, with a BMI of 27.

All European women look sleeker than the average American woman, however. 

They have an average BMI of 28.3.

In Russia, the figure is a chubby 27.2.

But the idyllic Pacific islands have the fattest women in the world. 

In the Cook Islands, the average BMI of 33.9 is officially considered “obese”. 

On the isle of Naura it is 35, borderline “morbidly obese”.



Study leader Professor Majid Ezzati, of Imperial College London, said: “Doing less exercise and eating more is taking its toll. 

The size of British people is increasing at a faster rate than most other countries. 

“The only other western countries showing the same trend are Australia, New Zealand and, of course, the US. 

“Food is more accessible than ever. 

It is so easy to pop into a shop and buy a chocolate cookie. 

Every other building seems to be a food outlet now. 

Even the smallest things can make a difference, such as walking or cycling to work instead of getting the bus or train.”

07-11-002_guardian,2011-02-09,Study: Global obesity rates double since 1980,"The world is becoming a heavier place, especially in the West. 

Obesity rates worldwide have doubled in the last three decades even as blood pressure and cholesterol levels have dropped, according to three new studies. 

People in Pacific Island nations like American Samoa are the heaviest, one of the studies shows. 

Among developed countries, Americans are the fattest and the Japanese are the slimmest. 

""Being obese is no longer just a Western problem,"" said Majid Ezzati, a professor of public health at Imperial College London, one of the study's authors. 

In 1980, about 5 percent of men and 8 percent of women worldwide were obese. 

By 2008, the rates were nearly 10 percent for men and 14 percent for women. 

That means 205 million men and 297 million women weighed in as obese. 

Another 1.5 billion adults were overweight, according to the obesity study. 

Though richer countries did a better job of keeping blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control, researchers said people nearly everywhere are piling on the pounds, except in a few places including central Africa and South Asia. 

The studies were published Friday in the medical journal, Lancet. 

The research confirms earlier trends about mounting obesity and the three papers provide the most comprehensive, recent global look at body mass index, cholesterol and blood pressure. 

Body mass index is a measurement based on weight and height. 

Experts warned the increasing numbers of obese people could lead to a ""global tsunami of cardiovascular disease."" 

Obesity is also linked to higher rates of cancer, diabetes and is estimated to cause about 3 million deaths worldwide every year. 

In an accompanying commentary, Sonia Anand and Salim Yusuf of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, said the global forecast for heart disease was ""dismal and comprises a population emergency that will cost tens of millions of preventable deaths"" unless countries take quick action. 

Even without the encroaching empire of Western fast food, Ezzati said waistlines are already expanding in parts of Latin America, the Middle East, and Western and Southern Africa. 

Among rich countries, the U.S. had the highest average body mass Index, at 28. 

Rates were the lowest in Japan, ranging between 22 for women and 24 for men. 

Women in Belgium, France, Finland, Italy and Switzerland also stayed trim, with virtually no change in their BMI. 

People with a BMI of 18-24 are considered to have a healthy weight. 

Those with a BMI of 25 or above are overweight and people with a BMI of 30 or more are classified as obese. 

Two other studies also published in the Lancet on Friday surveyed blood pressure rates and cholesterol levels. 

Western countries including Canada, South Korea and the U.S. had some of the lowest blood pressure rates thanks to medication, while rates are highest in Portugal, Finland and Norway. 

Cholesterol levels were highest in countries like Iceland and Germany and lowest in Africa. 

Ezzati said national measures like reducing salt content in prepared foods or banning transfats could make a big dent in lowering blood pressure and cholesterol rates. 

He added that it was uncertain if the world's obesity rates had peaked and predicted other health complications would soon follow. 

""We don't know how much worse the obesity problem will get,"" he said.

07-11-002_telegraph,2011-02-04,Britain has fattest women in Western Europe,"Britain now has the fattest women of any major Western European nation, a worldwide health study has found. 

Since 1980 the weight of the average British woman has increased by more than a stone (6.35kg) - leapfrogging countries including Spain, Italy, and Germany. 

At the start of the Eighties the average 5ft 3in British woman weighed 10 stone (63.5kg), but by 2008 that had grown to 11st 2lb (70.6kg). 

Only Malta and Israel - which was classified as Western Europe for the purposes of the report, published today online in The Lancet - now have fatter women. 

The global study compared the average body mass indices (BMIs) of men and women in 199 countries. 

It found British women's BMI has increased from 24.2 to 26.9, up from 12th equal fattest out of 23 nations, to third place. 

British men fared little better, with their BMI rising from 24.7 to 26.6, taking them from 17th to 5th place. 

Of the major Western European nations, only Spanish men are fatter. 

The weight of the average British 5ft 9in man has risen from 12 stone (76.1kg) to 12st 12lb (81.9kg). 

Doctors prefer BMI because it takes into account a person's height. 

It is calculated by dividing one's weight in kilograms by the square of one's height. 

The 'average British couple', if they exist, are now officially too fat for their own good. 

Under Department of Health guidelines, most adults should have a BMI of between 18.5 and 25. 

A BMI of between 25 and 30 is classed as overweight, while over 30 is obese. 

Numerous studies have found that people who are overweight or obese have a higher chance of developing heart disease and certain cancers. 

Intriguingly, the study explodes the myth that Italian women are fat. 

With a BMI of 24.8, they are the only group to have shed the pounds over the decades, and are now as svelte as their French cousins. 

Only Swiss women are slimmer. 

Tam Fry, of the National Obsity Forum, said successive governments since 1979 had undermined public health, by ""feeding children junk food in school, selliing off playing fields, and failing to tackle the food industry"". 

A related report in The Lancet does provide some good news for Western nations. 

While BMIs are rising, cholesterol and blood pressure are generally falling. 

Professor Majid Ezzati, senior author of the joint study, from the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, described this trend as ""heartening"". 

""Improved screening and treatment probably helped to lower these risk factors in high-income countries, as did using less salt and healthier, unsaturated fats,"" he said. 

Globally, the picture is worrying. 

Populations are rapidly getting fatter as prosperity brings more meat and products laden with fat and sugar to fridges and dining tables. 

People in Latin America and the Middle East are fattening up fastest. 

One adult in every 10 on the planet is now obese, or over half a billion people. 

Doctors fear global epidemics of heart disease and cancer are now unstoppable.","{""Lancet"": 2}","{""Tam Fry"": 1, ""Majid Ezzati"": 1}","{""The Lancet"": 2, ""BMI"": 2, ""Department of Health"": 1, ""the National Obsity Forum"": 1, ""the School of Public Health"": 1, ""Imperial College London"": 1}","{""Tam Fry"": 1, ""Majid Ezzati"": 1}","{""the National Obsity Forum"": 1, ""the School of Public Health"": 1, ""Imperial College London"": 1}"

The three maps below, which are drawn from a new global study led by Professor Majid Ezzati of Imperial College, London, and published in the Lancet, show that, Polynesia aside, obesity was a rich-world phenomenon in 1980. 

By 2008 the rich world had itself expanded, bringing obesity to groups within countries that were previously considered poor, such as Brazil and South Africa. 

During that period, the prevalence rate of obesity among men doubled to nearly 10%. 

One country has stubbornly resisted this trend. 

For all its dynamism since India opened up its economy in 1990, its men have on average become even thinner.

07-11-002_bbcnews,2011-02-04,Obesity affects one in 10 adults around the world,"One in 10 of the world's adults is obese, according to a joint UK-US study published in The Lancet

Imperial College London and Harvard researchers studied body mass index (BMI), cholesterol and high blood pressure data from 1980 to 2008. 

High blood pressure and cholesterol fell in many developed countries while obesity generally rose worldwide.

Men in the UK have the sixth highest BMI in Europe while UK women have the ninth highest BMI in Europe.

Obesity, cholesterol and high blood pressure are all risk factors for heart disease.

In 2008, 9.8% of men and 13.8% of women in the world were obese - they had a BMI above 30kg/m2. 

This is compared with 4.8% for men and 7.9% for women in 1980.

What is BMI - Body Mass Index?

BMI is measured by taking a person's weight in kg and dividing by the square of their height in metres.

A BMI of 18.5 to 25 is considered healthy, over 25 is deemed overweight and greater than 30 is obese. 

Pacific island nations had the highest average BMI in the world at 34-35kg/m2. 

This was up to 70% higher than some countries in south-east Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

In common with the rest of the world, BMI rose among most high-income countries. 

Among those countries, BMI rose the most in the USA between 1980 and 2008, followed by New Zealand and Australia for women and the UK and Australia for men.

Western countries bucking the BMI trend

Some countries in Western Europe succeeded in stabilising their BMI levels. 

There was virtually no rise in women's BMI in Belgium, Finland, France, Italy and Switzerland. 

Italy and Switzerland also saw the smallest increases in male BMI across the period.

However, while obesity rates in many countries across the world increased, many higher income countries succeeded in reducing both high blood pressure and cholesterol.

Large reductions in high blood pressure were seen, for example, in women in Australasia and men in North America.

Overall, the percentage of people in the world with high blood pressure fell slightly. 

However, for UK adults, blood pressure fell by less that most other European high-income countries.

Blood pressure levels were highest in the Baltic and East and West African countries. 

Systolic blood pressure levels reached 135 mmHg for women and 138 mmHg for men in those areas. 

UK BMI, Blood Pressure and Cholesterol Levels, 1980 - 2008

BMI LEVELS

BMI levels for UK men were 24.7 in 1980, rising to 27.4 in 2008.

BMI levels for women were 24.2 in 1980 and 26.9 in 2008.

BLOOD PRESSURE LEVELS

Systolic Blood Pressure levels were measured - that's the pressure while the heart is pumping blood around. It is measured in millimetres of mercury.

In 1980 men had blood pressure of 136.5 mmHg falling to 131.2 in 2008.

In 1980 women had blood pressure levels of 131.0 falling to 124.1 in 2008. 

CHOLESTEROL LEVELS 

Cholesterol blood levels were measured in millimoles per litre (mmol/L). 

In 1980 men's cholesterol blood levels were 6.2mmol/L, falling to 5.4mmol/L in 2008.

In 1980 women's cholesterol blood levels were 6.2mmol/L falling to 5.4mmol/L in 2008

Average levels of total blood cholesterol fell across many Western countries including North America, Australasia and Europe. 

In the UK men and women both showed one of the largest drops in cholesterol in high income countries. 

However the UK's cholesterol is still ninth highest in the world.

Conversely, blood cholesterol levels increased in the East, south-east Asia and the Pacific region.

Professor Majid Ezzati, a lead author of the study welcomed the improved results in high blood pressure and cholesterol in higher income countries, saying: ""It's heartening that many countries have successfully reduced blood pressure and cholesterol despite rising BMI. 

""Improved screening and treatment probably helped to lower these risk factors in high-income countries, as did using less salt and healthier, unsaturated fats.""

The British Heart Foundation (BHF) said the increasing obesity rates were ""striking.""

While men leap to 'black-or-white' judgments, women tend to be open-minded and 'see more shades of grey', scientists say.

In a study, more than 100 people were asked whether each of 50 objects fitted partially, fully or not at all into categories.

Women were 23 per cent more likely to select the 'partial' one.

Their 'indecisive' responses were to questions likely to stimulate debate, such as 'is paint a tool?'

It has long been thought that there is a gender split over decision-making. But researchers say it is the first time men have been shown to make absolute choices.

Most men decide, for example, that a tomato is either a fruit or not, while women say it can 'sort of' belong in the fruit category.

Researcher Dr Zachary Estes, of Warwick University, said: 'Men are more suited to occupational environments that require decisive action. Women are better at jobs needing a considered approach.'

Promising evidence that adults may be better able to control their condition overnight has emerged from a Cambridge University-led study involving 24 adults.

It was funded by the charity Diabetes UK and follows encouraging research using similar equipment on pregnant mothers and children with Type 1 diabetes.

Type 1 usually strikes people before they are 40 and affects about one in 10 of those with diabetes.

They need to test their own blood sugar levels regularly before injecting themselves with insulin or setting a pump that releases the hormone via a cannula under the skin.

The new system involves placing a small circular patch on the body that continuously monitors glucose levels, sending the results by radio signals to the insulin pump, which then automatically delivers the appropriate amount of insulin.

This should reduce the incidence of ""hypos"" - when blood sugar levels fall too low - possibly rendering a person unconscious.

The latest tests, involving 10 men and 14 women, suggested a 22% improvement in the time participants kept their blood glucose levels in a safe range, halving the time they spent with low blood-glucose levels and reducing the risk of both short- and long-term complications.

Iain Frame, head of research at Diabetes UK, said: ""The improvements in glucose control overnight are impressive.

06-11-007_dailymail,2011-03-12,Medical U-turn on ‘apple-shape’ warnings: It isn’t especially dangerous to the heart,"A medical U-turn has cast doubt on warnings that being overweight and 'apple-shaped' is especially dangerous to the heart.

Researchers who studied 220,000 adults found that fat concentrated around the waist did not increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes any more than general obesity.

Their findings contradict previous evidence that obese individuals with 'apple-shaped' bodies are three times more likely to suffer a heart attack than those with other kinds of fat distribution.

The authors of the new research argue that earlier studies had delivered a misleading message because of design flaws.

Experts said the results should help end confusion over different international guidelines.

Obesity as measured by a person's Body Mass Index, which relates weight and height, and is a known risk factor for heart disease.

But recent research has suggested that being fat around the middle is especially bad, increasing the risk over and above that resulting from having a high BMI.

Some experts have even challenged the usefulness of BMI as an assessment tool, arguing in favour of the tape measure instead.

The new investigation involved examining data from 58 studies which collectively monitored more than 220,000 adults for almost a decade.

During this period, more than 14,000 participants suffered a heart attack or stroke.

Analysis confirmed that obesity was a major risk factor for heart disease.

But the risk remained the same whether worked out from BMI scores - calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared - waist circumference, or waist-to-hip 

Waist-to-hip ratio compares the distance around the hips and waist to assess levels of 'central obesity'.

It shows if a person is 'apple-shaped' with a bulging middle or 'pear-shaped' with a narrower waist and fatter hips and bottom.

A consortium of 200 scientists from 17 countries carried out the study, funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and British Heart Foundation (BHF).

The findings are published today in The Lancet medical journal online.

The authors, led by Professor John Danesh, from Cambridge University, wrote: 'Whether assessed singly or in combination, body-mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio do not improve prediction of first-onset cardiovascular disease when additional information exists on blood pressure, history of diabetes, and cholesterol measures.

This finding applies to a wide range of circumstances and clinically relevant subgroups.'

Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director at the BHF, said: 'Regardless of how you measure it, being obese is bad for your heart.

This study suggests that measuring your waist is no better than calculating your BMI but it's not time to throw away the tape measure just yet.

'We tend to underestimate our body shape and size, so measuring our waist or checking our BMI are both quick and easy ways we can check our health at home.

Doctors have long thought that people with an apple figure - a tendency to store fat around the belly rather than the hips - were at a higher risk of heart disease and stroke.

In 2005, a study seemed to confirm that theory.

It found that having a higher waist-to-hip ratio - in other words being an ""apple"" - was three times more powerful an indicator of heart attack risk than simply being overweight.

Dr Arya Sharma, the director of the Canadian Obesity Network, who led that study, said it would lead to doctors ""forgetting about their scales and taking out their tape measures"".

But a recent analysis of records from 220,000 people in 58 studies, each monitored for over a decade, has cast doubt on this finding.

It discovered that having a higher waist-to-hip ratio was no better a predictor of heart disease and stroke risk than being generally overweight, as measured by body mass index (BMI).

BMI is calculated by dividing one's weight in kilograms by the square of one's height in metres.

The researchers, led by Cambridge University, concluded in The Lancet that their findings ""reliably refute"" previous recommendations to measure waist-tohip ratios rather than BMI.

""We have shown that BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio each have a similar strength of association with cardiovascular disease risk,"" they wrote.

Furthermore, the new study found that the really powerful indicators were not body weight or shape at all, but what was going on in the blood.

Once blood pressure, a history of diabetes and cholesterol levels were taken into account, neither body weight nor shape added much in terms of predicting a cardiovascular event.

Researchers at Cambridge University's cardiovascular epidemiology unit said: ""This study shows that measuring your waist is no better for calculating your cardiovascular risk than calculating your BMI.

It underlines the value of GPs continuing to measure cholesterol and blood pressure levels, irrespective of body shape.""

However, they emphasised that being overweight or obese was still ""the main risk factor for heart disease, which can of course be influenced by lifestyle choices"".

The authors believe that previous studies could have been affected by selection bias and reverse causality - when cause and effect are mixed up.

But Dr Mike Knapton, the associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, which co-funded the study with the Medical Research Council, said it was ""not time to throw away the tape measure just yet"".

Being overweight and having high cholesterol and blood pressure often went hand-in-hand, he said, so gauging a person's weight was a useful initial ""screen"" of whether they might go on to suffer heart disease or stroke.

Two-thirds of British adults are either overweight or obese.

A study in the Lancet found the risk of heart attack was not increased by fat being concentrated around the waist. 

It contradicts previous work that found overweight people with ""apple shaped"" bodies were three times as likely to suffer heart attacks than those with more generally distributed fat.

But experts warned obesity was bad for the heart, no matter where the fat was.

The authors of the study say that obesity is still a major risk factor for heart disease, but they argue there is confusion about the best way to measure it. 

One well known measure is the Body Mass Index (BMI) which relates weight to height.

Apples and pears 

But previous research had also suggested that people with fat deposits in the middle of their body - known as an ""apple shape"" - were at much greater risk.

This method uses the ""waist-to-hip"" ratio and compares the distance around the hips and waist to measure what is known as central obesity.

It can tell if someone is ""apple shaped - with a bulging middle - or ""pear shaped"", with a narrower waist and fatter hips and bottom. 

Others have suggested concentrating on a measurement of the waist alone.

But this new study, which looked at 220,000 people over almost 10 years, found that all three measures indicated risk of heart attack or stroke.

The study was led by Professor John Danesh from Cambridge University and concluded that none of the measures on their own improved the prediction of heart disease, especially when doctors could also assess other warning signs like blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

Writing in the Lancet, Professor Danesh said: ""Whether assessed singly or in combination, body-mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio do not improve prediction of first-onset cardiovascular disease when additional information exists on blood pressure, history of diabetes, and cholesterol measures.""

The study was funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the British Heart Foundation (BHF).

Obesity is still bad for you 

The BHF's associate medical director Dr Mike Knapton said it was clear that no matter how you measure it, obesity is bad for your heart. 

""This study suggests that measuring your waist is no better than calculating your BMI but it's not time to throw away the tape measure just yet.

""Anyone over 40 who's worried about their waist measurement or BMI should ask at their GP surgery for a heart health assessment, which will take into account all cardiovascular risk factors and provide practical advice on how you can reduce your risk.""

Professor Stephen Holgate of the MRC said the main worry about obesity was that it led to other illnesses.

06-11-007_reuters,2011-03-11,"""Apple"" obesity heart risk theory goes pear-shaped","New research is challenging previous medical notions that ""apple-shaped"" people with more fat around their waist are at higher risk of heart attacks and strokes than ""pear-shaped"" people with fatter bottoms and hips.

A study of 220,000 people published Friday confirmed that being obese -- having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more -- is a major risk factor for heart disease, but found the distribution of fat on the body has no impact on that risk.

""Regardless of how you measure it, being obese is bad for your heart.

This study suggests that measuring your waist is no better than calculating your BMI,"" said Mike Knapton, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation charity, which part-funded the study.

BMI is widely used by researchers and doctors to determine people's health risks.

It is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared.

A person who is 5 feet 5 inches tall has a BMI of 25 and is classified as overweight at 150 pounds (68 kg), and has a BMI of 30 and is classified as obese at 180 pounds (82 kg).

According to researchers writing in The Lancet medical journal, previous studies have suggested that people with ""central obesity"" -- often described as apple-shaped people -- have a three times greater risk of heart attack than people with general obesity as measured by BMI.

But other experts have questioned those findings, so a large international consortium of scientists set out to try and settle the issue.

Their results suggest that while monitoring weight and fat levels may be important to try to get people to change their lifestyles, the best predictors of future heart risk are measures of blood pressure, cholesterol and history of diabetes.

The Lancet study involved taking weight, hip, waist, blood pressure, cholesterol and other key data from more than 220,000 adults -- who had no previous history of heart disease -- and tracking them for almost a decade.

During that time, around 14,000 of them had heart attacks or strokes.

John Danesh of Britain's Cambridge University, one of the almost 200 scientists from 17 countries who worked on the study, said the findings showed that ""basically, all obesity types are broadly as bad as each other"" when it comes to heart health.

Danesh said the findings should help guide medical practice worldwide because at the moment, national and international guidelines provide differing recommendations about the value of assessing obesity levels to predict future heart risk.

""This study very clearly shows that if conventional risk factors (such as blood pressure and cholesterol) have already been measured, then measures of levels of fat add very little,"" he said in a telephone interview.

Obesity has become a global epidemic, with more than half a billion people, or one in 10 adults worldwide, now considered to be obese -- more than double the number in 1980.

Cardiovascular diseases -- which can lead to heart attacks, strokes and other fatal events -- are the top cause of death worldwide, killing around 17.1 million people a year, according to the World health Organization (WHO).","{""Lancet medical journal"": 1}","{""Mike Knapton"": 1, ""John Danesh"": 1, ""Danesh"": 1}","{""the British Heart Foundation"": 1, ""The Lancet"": 1, ""BMI"": 1, ""Lancet"": 1, ""Cambridge University"": 1, ""the World health Organization"": 1, ""WHO"": 1}","{""John Danesh"": 1, ""Danesh"": 1}","{""the British Heart Foundation"": 1, ""BMI"": 1, ""Cambridge University"": 1, ""the World health Organization"": 1, ""WHO"": 1}"
03-11-028_dailymail,2011-09-10,GENE CLUE TO HELP CURE BACK PAIN,"FOR those of us who are martyrs to our backs, help could be at hand Ð in a few years' time, anyway.

Scientists claim to have identified the gene behind back pain, in a development that could lead to effective treatment within a decade.

Experts at Cambridge University said their research into the HCN2 gene could provide relief to millions.

About one in seven Britons suffer from so-called chronic back pain, which can also include arthritis and headaches.

This chronic pain comes in two main varieties. Inflammatory ailments occur when a persistent injury results in very sensitive nerve endings, which increases the sensation of pain. 

The other kind Ð neuropathic Ð is felt when nerves are damaged, causing ongoing, and often permanent, pain.

This is often seen in patients with diabetes and shingles and in the aftermath of cancer chemotherapy Ð as well as in cases of back pain.

When researchers removed the HCN2 gene from pain-sensitive nerves in mice, they put a stop to their neuropathic pain.

However, the mice were still able to feel acute pain, which occurs suddenly, such as when biting one's tongue.

Professor Peter McNaughton, lead author of the study and head of Cambridge's department of pharmacology, said a drug based on his team's research could be available within a decade.

 'Individuals suffering from neuropathic pain often have little or no respite because of the lack of effective medications,' he said.

'Our research lays the groundwork for the development of new drugs to treat chronic pain by blocking HCN2.'

Prof McNaughton told the journal Science: 'Many genes play a critical role in pain sensation, but in most cases interfering with them simply abolishes all pain, or even all sensation.

'What is exciting about the work on the HCN2 gene is that removing it Ð or blocking it pharmacologically Ð eliminates neuropathic pain without affecting normal acute pain.

03-11-028_express,2011-09-10,Found . . . a gene to help beat back pain for ever,"THE agony of long-term back pain could soon be over after scientists discovered the role of a rogue gene behind the condition.

Experts at Cambridge University have identified a gene called HCN which could help them develop drugs to combat long-lasting back pain.

Up to one in five Britons suffer from chronic back pain, which can also include debilitating conditions such as arthritis and headaches.

The findings, which have been hailed as a ""major breakthrough"", open up the possibility that new drugs could be developed to block the protein produced by the HCN2 gene, which regulates chronic pain.

The HCN2 gene, which is expressed in pain-sensitive nerve endings, has been known for several years, but its role in regulating pain is not fully understood.

The researchers removed the HCN2 gene from pain-sensitive nerves in mice.

By measuring the speed that the mice withdrew from different types of painful stimuli, they concluded that deleting the HCN2 gene abolished pain.

However, they found that deleting HCN2 did not affect normal acute pain - which occurs suddenly, for example when biting one's tongue - a factor they said was important since this type of pain acts as a useful warning signal to the body. 

Chronic pain comes in two main varieties and is an enormous health burden worldwide. 

Inflammatory pain occurs when a persistent injury, such as a burn, results in very sensitive nerve endings and increased pain.

Neuropathic pain occurs when nerves are damaged, causing ongoing pain. 

This type of chronic pain, which is often lifelong, is surprisingly common and is poorly treated by current drugs, the study found.

It is often seen in patients with diabetes and shingles, and in the aftermath of cancer chemotherapy. 

It is also common in lower back pain and other chronic painful conditions.

Lead author Professor Peter McNaughton, said a drug based on his research could be available within a decade.

""Individuals suffering from neuropathic pain often have little or no respite because of the lack of effective medications, "" said Professor McNaughton.

""Our research lays the groundwork for the development of new drugs to treat chronic pain by blocking HCN2.""

03-11-028_reuters,2011-09-08,Scientists find gene that controls chronic pain,"(Reuters) - British scientists have identified a gene responsible for regulating chronic pain, called HCN2, and say their discovery should help drug researchers in their search for more effective, targeted pain-killing medicines.



Scientists from Cambridge University said that if drugs could be designed to block the protein produced by the gene, they could treat a type of pain known as neuropathic pain, which is linked to nerve damage and often very difficult to control with currently available drugs.

""Individuals suffering from neuropathic pain often have little or no respite because of the lack of effective medications,"" said Peter McNaughton of Cambridge's pharmacology department, who led the study.

""Our research lays the groundwork for the development of new drugs to treat chronic pain by blocking HCN2.""

Pain is an enormous health burden worldwide, estimated to cost more than 200 billion euros ($281 billion) a year in Europe and around $150 billion a year in the United States.

Studies show that around 22 percent of people with chronic pain become depressed and 25 percent go on to lose their jobs.

 A 2002/03 survey by a group called Pain in Europe estimated that as many as one in five Europeans suffers chronic pain.

Scientists have known about the HCN2 gene, which is found in pain-sensitive nerve endings, for several years, but had not yet fully understood its role in regulating pain.

Because a related gene called HCN4 plays a critical role in controlling electrical activity in the heart, McNaughton's team suspected that HCN2 might have a similar function and regulate electrical activity in pain-sensitive nerves.

For the study, published in the journal Science on Thursday, the researchers engineered the removal of the HCN2 gene from pain-sensitive nerves and then used electrical stimuli on these nerves in lab dishes to find out how the nerves had been changed by the removal of HCN2.

The scientists then studied genetically modified mice in which the HCN2 gene had been deleted.

 By measuring the speed the mice withdrew from different types of painful stimuli, the scientists were able to show that deleting the HCN2 gene took away neuropathic pain.

They also found that deleting HCN2 appeared to have no effect on normal acute pain -- such as the type of pain caused by accidentally cutting yourself or biting your own tongue -- a factor they said was important since this type of pain acts as a useful warning signal to the body.

""What is exciting about the work on the HCN2 gene is that removing it -- or blocking it pharmacologically -- eliminates neuropathic pain without affecting normal acute pain,"" McNaughton said in a statement about this work.

 ""This finding could be very valuable clinically because normal pain sensation is essential for avoiding accidental damage.""

Neuropathic pain, which is distinguished from inflammatory pain, is seen in patients with diabetes -- a condition which affects an estimated 280 million people around the world -- and as a painful after-effect of shingles and of chemotherapy in cancer patients.

The discovery could lead to better understanding of speech disorders and dyslexia.

The ROBO1 gene directs chemicals in brain cells that help infants store and translate the speech sounds they hear into meaningful language. This process is an essential part of language learning for the very young, when words are at first meaningless, until associated with an object or concept.

""The infant language acquisition system is quintessentially human and yet is a complex system requiring many brain regions,"" said Timothy Bates, of the university's school of philosophy, psychology and language sciences.

The University of Edinburgh staff found the gene ROBO1 linked to the mechanism in the brain that helps infants develop speech.

They said it could help explain how some aspects of language learning in infants is influenced by genetic traits rather than educational factors.

The five-year study was conducted on 538 families with up to five children. 

The scientists found a significant link between the way the ROBO1 gene functions and the brain's ability to store speech sounds for a brief period of time, and that one version of the gene greatly enhanced a core component of language learning.

03-11-006_dailymail,2011-01-27,The eternal chronometer: How our body clock has remained unchanged for millions of years,"Scientists have identified the universal ancient body clock that regulates the behaviour of all forms of life.

The internal chronometer tells the body what should be happening at different times during the 24-hour cycle and when it should take place.

The researchers found that the version today is unchanged from the earliest forms of life on Earth like algae and dates back millions of years.

Its discovery could shed light on a range of human conditions such as depression, cancer and diabetes and provide relief to workers such as pilots or nurses who do odd hours.

Studies have long shown that working irregular shifts increases the risk of catching a range of conditions and puts employees at greater risk of mental illness.

 

The studies from the University of Cambridge and the University of Edinburgh examined the circadian clock which controls patterns of seasonal activity in everything from sleep cycles to butterfly migration.

In the first study, Cambridge scientists found that red blood cells have a 24-hour rhythm.

This is an important step because circadian rhythms have always been assumed to be linked to DNA and gene activity, but unlike most other cells in the body red blood cells do not have DNA.

The second study found a similar 24-hour cycle in marine algae suggesting that internal body clocks have always been important, even for ancient forms of life.

Scientists had previously thought the circadian clock was driven by gene activity, but both the algae and the red blood cells kept time without it, meaning other factors were at play.

Dr Akhilesh Reddy, a neuroscientist with Cambridge University who led the first study, said: ‘The implications of this for health are manifold.

'We already know that disrupted clocks - for example, caused by shift-work and jet-lag - are associated with metabolic disorders such as diabetes, mental health problems and even cancer.

‘By furthering our knowledge of how the 24-hour clock in cells works, we hope that the links to these disorders - and others - will be made clearer.

‘This will, in the longer term, lead to new therapies that we couldn't even have thought about a couple of years ago.’

Professor Andrew Millar of the University of Edinburgh's School of Biological Sciences, who led the second study, added: ‘This ground-breaking research shows that body clocks are ancient mechanisms that have stayed with us through a billion years of evolution.

‘They must be far more important and sophisticated than we previously realised.

14-11-004_telegraph,2011-01-13,Scientists bring cancer cells back under control,"A new treatment for cancer that renders malignant tumours ""dormant"" has been developed by scientists. 

Researchers believe they have found a way of making malignant cancer cells benign, stopping them from spreading around the body and so threatening life. 

The revolutionary approach works by switching back on the body's natural cancer suppressor genes that have been turned off by the disease. 

While it does not reduce the tumour that is already formed it stops it spreading around the body. 

The team at Nottingham University have tested the treatment on animals and have had a 100 per cent success rate and are now hoping to team up with a pharmaceutical company to develop it for humans. 

The Research, published in the Journal Molecular Cancer, reveals how Dr Cinzia Allegrucci and Dr Andrew Johnson centres around reactivating tumour suppressor genes. 

Ordinarily cell division is controlled by specific genes that kill or mend rogue or damaged cells. 

But cancers occur when these go wrong – especially if tumour suppressor genes are for some reason turned off. 

The team used a new technique that involves using proteins from salamanders that have been shown in the past to be able to switch on and off human genes. 

When they were mixed with breast cancer cells, the team were amazed to find they reactivated the cancer suppression genes. 

In mice given breast cancer, an injection of the proteins stopped the cancer in its tracks. 

Now they want to isolate exactly what proteins were involved in ""rebooting"" the cells and reproduce them as a drug. 

Nell Barrie, science information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: ""It's becoming clear that cancer is driven not just by faulty genes but by changes in cells that help to switch genes on and off. 

""This interesting new technique will shed light on how this process contributes to the disease, and further research could one day lead to new treatments that help to reverse these complex changes in cancer cells.""","{""Journal Molecular Cancer"": 1}","{""Cinzia Allegrucci"": 1, ""Andrew Johnson"": 1, ""Nell Barrie"": 1}","{""Nottingham University"": 1, ""Research"": 1, ""the Journal Molecular Cancer"": 1, ""Cancer Research UK"": 1}","{""Cinzia Allegrucci"": 1, ""Andrew Johnson"": 1}","{""Nottingham University"": 1, ""Research"": 2, ""the Journal Molecular Cancer"": 1, ""Cancer Research UK"": 1}"
19-11-014_dailymail,2011-12-05,Violent homes have the 'same effect on brains of children as combat does on soldiers',"The brains of children are affected by family violence in the same way as combat affects soldiers, according to a study.

In both cases the brain becomes increasingly wary of potential threats.

For children, the changes may increase susceptibility to mental health problems, say experts from University College London (UCL) and the Anna Freud Centre.

Children who suffer abuse or witness domestic violence are known to be at greater risk of anxiety and depression in later life.

Scientists carried out magnetic resonance imaging brain scans on 20 London children with an average age of 12 who had been exposed to documented violence at home.

All had been referred to local social services.

While in the scanner, the children were shown pictures of male and female faces with sad, calm or angry expressions.

Their patterns of brain activity were compared with those of 23 matched children with no history of family violence.

The children exposed to violence responded in a distinct way to angry faces, the study found.

Their brains showed heightened activation in two regions associated with threat detection, the anterior insula and amygdala.

Previous research has shown a similar pattern in the brains of soldiers exposed to violence combat situations.

The scans suggest both combat veteran soldiers and children who witness violence tune their brains to be hyper-aware of environmental danger.

Lead author Dr Eamon McCrory, from UCL's Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, said: ‘We are only now beginning to understand how child abuse influences functioning of the brain's emotional systems.

This research is important because it provides our first clues as to how regions in the child's brain may adapt to early experiences of abuse in the home.

 ‘Enhanced reactivity to a biologically salient threat cue such as anger may represent an adaptive response for these children in the short term, helping keep them out of danger.

However, it may also constitute an underlying neurobiological risk factor increasing their vulnerability to later mental health problems, and particularly anxiety.

‘The next step for us is to try and understand how stable these changes are. Not every child exposed to family violence will go on to develop a mental health problem; many bounce back and lead successful lives.

We want to know much more about those mechanisms that help some children become resilient.’

The anterior insula and amygdala are both implicated in anxiety disorders, the researchers pointed out.

Professor Peter Fonagy, chief executive of the Anna Freud Centre and Professor of Psychology at UCL, said: ‘Dr McCrory's groundbreaking research has undoubtedly taken us an important step closer to understanding the devastation which exposing children to violence can leave in its wake.

His exciting findings confirm the traumatic effects these experiences have on brain development.

‘The report should energise clinicians and social workers to double their efforts to safeguard children from violence.

By helping us understand the consequences of maltreatment the findings also offer fresh inspiration for the development of effective treatment strategies to protect children from the consequences of maltreatment.’

Eamon McCrory at University College London used fMRI to scan the brains of 20 outwardly healthy children who had been maltreated and 23 ""controls"" from safe environments.

During the scans, the children, aged 12 on average, viewed a mixture of sad, neutral and angry faces.

When they saw angry faces, the maltreated children showed extra activity in the amygdala and the anterior insula, known to be involved in threat detection and anticipation of pain.

Combat soldiers show similar heightened activity (Current Biology, DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2011.10.015).

""Our belief is that these changes could reflect neural adaption,"" says McCrory.

""Maltreated kids and active soldiers are adapting to survive in a threatening or dangerous environment.""

Although this could help children survive their early years, it may predispose them to mental health problems in adulthood, such as depression or anxiety, says McCrory.

A related study, published this week by Hilary Blumberg of Yale University School of Medicine and colleagues, demonstrates that areas of the brain important for emotional processing are deficient in grey matter in adolescents who suffered from maltreatment as children (Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, DOI: 10.1001/archpediatrics.2011.565).

19-11-014_reuters,2011-12-05,Study finds how child abuse changes the brain,"Children exposed to family violence show the same pattern of activity in their brains as soldiers exposed to combat, scientists said on Monday.

In a study in the journal Current Biology, researchers used brain scans to explore the impact of physical abuse or domestic violence on children's emotional development and found that exposure to it was linked to increased activity in two brain areas when children were shown pictures of angry faces.

Previous studies that scanned the brains of soldiers exposed to violent combat situations showed the same pattern of heightened activity in these two brain areas -- the anterior insula and the amygdala -- which experts say are associated with detecting potential threats.

This suggests that both maltreated children and soldiers may have adapted to become ""hyper-aware"" of danger in their environment, the researchers said.

""Enhanced reactivity to a...threat cue such as anger may represent an adaptive response for these children in the short term, helping keep them out of danger,"" said Eamon McCrory of Britain's University College London, who led the study.

But he added that such responses may also be underlying neurobiological risk factor which increases the children's susceptibility to later mental illness like depression.

Depression is already a major cause of mortality, disability, and economic burden worldwide and the World Health Organization predicts that by 2020, it will be the second leading contributor to the global burden of disease across all ages.

Childhood maltreatment is known to be one of the most potent environmental risk factors linked to later mental health problems such as anxiety disorders and depression.

A study published in August found that found that people who suffered maltreatment as children were twice as likely as those who had normal childhoods to develop persistent and recurrent depression, and less likely to respond well or quickly to treatment for their mental illness.

McCrory said still relatively little is known about how such early adversity ""gets under the skin and increases a child's later vulnerability, even into adulthood.""

In the study, 43 children had their brains scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

Twenty of the children who were known to have been exposed to violence at home were compared with 23 who had not experienced family violence.

The average age of the maltreated children was 12 years and they had all been referred to local social services in London.

When the children were in the scanner they were shown pictures of male and female faces showing sad, calm or angry expressions.

The researchers found that those who had been exposed to violence showed increased brain activity in the anterior insula and amygdala in response to the angry faces.

The discovery could herald the start of a new era in managing the condition, known as hypertension, which affects more than 10 million Britons.

Professor Morris Brown, of the University of Cambridge and Addenbrooke's Hospital, said: ""This study breaks the mould for treating hypertension.

""Most patients can now be prescribed a single combination pill and know that they are optimally protected from strokes and heart attacks.""

At present, patients with high blood pressure are given a single drug at a very low dose.

This can slowly be increased if it fails to have an impact and other drugs can be added but it means it can take months for patients to reach their optimum blood pressure levels and many complain of side effects.

It also creates a delay during which some patients may suffer a heart attack or stroke.

The latest study, published in The Lancet medical journal, shows that patients started on the combined drugs reduced their blood pressure quickly and also suffered fewer side effects.

The study was carried out at Cambridge University in collaboration with the Universities of Dundee and Glasgow, and the British Hypertension Society.

Professor Tom MacDonald, of Dundee University, said: ""The research is a great result for patients with high blood pressure.

Starting with two medicines is clearly better than starting with one and there were fewer side effects.""

The study of 1,250 patients showed that those given a single tablet containing a combination of drugs had a 25 per cent better response during the first six months of treatment than patients on conventional doses.

The pill combines the drugs amlodipine and aliskiren.

It means patients receive double the usual dose of blood pressure medication.

The team found that blood pressure readings for those on conventional treatment never caught up with those on the new treatment, even when they were all treated with the same combination of drugs.

This is because the body may become resistant to a single drug but does not when two are combined.

Professor Jeremy Pearson, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ""This study adds significantly to the evidence that starting treatment for patients with high blood pressure with two medicines rather than one is safe, and more effective than waiting to add the second medicine later.""

Q&A

What is high blood pressure?

Pressure of blood in the arteries builds up to unsafe levels known as hypertension.

A reading of more than 140/90 mmHg is considered high.

How many people have it?

About 10 million.

Why is it dangerous?

It raises the chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke.

What causes it?

There are a range of causes.

For a few people, hypertension results from a medical condition such as a hormone imbalance or kidney problems.

For the vast majority, it is the consequence of poor diet, too much salt, a lack of exercise, smoking and drinking too much alcohol.

Blood pressure also rises as we age.

What are the symptoms?

Very few obvious effects so hypertension is usually spotted during a routine GP visit when an inflatable arm cuff is used.

Can it be cured?

No. But there are a range of drug treatments including angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers and diuretics.

Patients often take a combination of pills.

Anything else people can do?

Get to a healthy weight and slash salt intake.

Studies suggest that tens of thousands of lives would be saved.

People are advised to eat no more than six grammes of salt a day but most eat far more and convenience food products often contain high levels.

Eating more fruit and vegetables will also help.","{""Lancet medical journal"": 1}","{""Morris Brown"": 1, ""Tom MacDonald"": 1, ""Jeremy Pearson"": 1}","{""the University of Cambridge"": 1, ""Addenbrooke's Hospital"": 1, ""The Lancet"": 1, ""Cambridge University"": 1, ""the Universities of Dundee"": 1, ""the British Hypertension Society"": 1, ""Dundee University"": 1, ""the British Heart Foundation"": 1}",,"{""the University of Cambridge"": 1, ""Addenbrooke's Hospital"": 1, ""Cambridge University"": 1, ""the Universities of Dundee"": 1, ""the British Hypertension Society"": 1, ""Dundee University"": 1, ""the British Heart Foundation"": 1}"
03-11-004_telegraph,2011-01-13,Two blood pressure drugs better than one: research,"Patients with high blood pressure should be prescribed a combination drug because it is 25 per cent more effective than the traditional treatment, researchers have discovered. 



The results ""break the mould"" for treating high blood pressure and are likely to change the way doctors treat the condition, the Cambridge University researchers said. 

Patients with very high blood pressure - a major risk factor for heart attacks and strokes - often need more than one drug over a period of months to control it. 

However the new study found it is best to start treatment with two medicines together as this reduces blood pressure by 25 per cent compared to using one drug at a time. 

This results in much faster and more effective control of blood pressure, with fewer side effects, they said. 

Professor Morris Brown, from Cambridge University, who led the trial, said: ""The Accelerate study breaks the mould for treating hypertension (high blood pressure).

Most patients can now be prescribed a single combination pill and know that they are optimally protected from strokes and heart attacks."" 

Professor Bryan Williams, from the British Hypertension Society, said: ""This study is important and the findings could change the way we approach the treatment of high blood pressure."" 

The research, which involved 1,250 patients with high blood pressure, is published in an early online edition of The Lancet medical journal. 

It shows that starting treatment with the two drugs aliskiren and amlodipine in a combination pill reduced blood pressure on average by 25 per cent more than one drug. 

The scientists suspect taking the drugs in series allows the body to neutralise each of them in turn. Having them together may prevent this from happening. 

Professor Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: “This study adds significantly to the evidence that starting treatment for patients with high blood pressure with two medicines rather than one is safe, and more effective than waiting to add the second medicine later. 

“Good control of blood pressure is still hard to achieve in many patients.

So the BHF is currently funding follow-up trials to this research that will find out the best way to treat patients whose hypertension is still poorly controlled with two drugs, and who need extra medicines.”

The trial involving 1,250 patients found that using two drugs Ð aliskiren and amlodipine Ð in a single tablet improved speed and effectiveness of the treatment, with fewer side effects.

Almost ten million people in the UK are believed to have hypertension, or high blood pressure, which is a major risk factor for heart attacks and stroke.

Normally doctors treat patients with hypertension initially with one drug while other medicines are added if needed over a period of months.

However, the latest research suggests that it is best to start treatment with two medicines at the same time.

Experts at Cambridge University found that the combination treatment produces a 25 per cent better response in patients than conventional monotherapy.

The findings, published in the medical journal The Lancet, were welcomed by doctors. Cardiologist Professor Graham MacGregor, of the Blood Pressure Association, says: 'Aliskiren is a new drug but there are a number of combination pills already available to patients.

This study suggests they are more effective than single drugs, if started straight away, and doctors should consider prescribing them.

'The other benefits of combination therapy is lower prescription costs and one less pill for patients to remember to take.'

03-11-004_bbcnews,2011-01-13,High blood pressure combination pill 'better than one',"A combination of drugs is better than a single one in treating high blood pressure, a UK study has suggested.

The study in the Lancet involved 1,200 people and found starting treatment with two drugs gave better and faster results, with fewer side effects.

The approach challenges conventional medical practice where doctors give a patient one drug, then add another later if blood pressure stays high.

Almost 10 million people in the UK have high blood pressure.

Treatment with anti-hypertensive drugs is known to reduce the risk of stroke and heart disease.

A team led by researchers at the University of Cambridge, University of Glasgow and University of Dundee followed 1,254 patients with high blood pressure in 10 countries.

They compared the effects of giving one drug (either aliskiren or amlodipine) or a combination of both.

Patients given the combination of drugs had a 25% better response during the first six months compared with those on conventional treatment, the study found. 

This equates to a 6.5mm Hg greater reduction in systolic blood pressure.

Participants were also less likely to stop taking their medication due to side effects.

The two drugs can be given as a single pill, making it easier for patients to take.

Professor Morris Brown of the University of Cambridge said the study ""breaks the mould for treating hypertension"".

He said: ""Most patients can now be prescribed a single combination pill and know that they are optimally protected from strokes and heart attacks.""

The results of a study known as ACCELERATE also showed that patients who switched from single drug treatment to combined therapy improved their response, but not to the same level as those who started their treatment with the combination.

The findings, by researchers at the Swiss drugmaker and at Britain's University of Cambridge, could boost prospects for Novartis's Tekamlo tablet, a single-pill treatment which combines the two drugs tested -- aliskiren, also made by Novartis, and the generic blood pressure medicine amlodipine.

""One of the benefits we think will come out of this research is that patients should now receive combination therapy from the start (of their treatment),"" said Morris Brown at Cambridge University, who led the study.

Experts not directly involved in the research, which was published in The Lancet medical journal, agreed and said treatment guidelines should now be changed.

""ACCELERATE puts into proper context the importance of starting with combination antihypertensives to lower blood pressure towards guideline goals for the general population ... A change in guidelines is clearly necessary,"" Ivana Lazich and George Bakris of the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine in the United States wrote in a commentary.

Aliskiren, sold under the brand names Tekturna and Rasilez, had global sales for Novartis of $290 million in 2009.

It was launched in 2007 after it was found in clinical trials to lower blood pressure better than an ACE inhibitor, one of the types of drugs currently given to heart attack patients. 

Tekturna's success is crucial for Novartis since Diovan, also a high blood pressure treatment, loses patent protection in 2012.

The combination pill Tekamlo was approved in August last year by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. [ID:nLDE67Q05M]

An estimated 1 billion people globally have high blood pressure, or hypertension, which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death globally.

If left untreated high blood pressure can cause strokes, heart attacks, heart failure and organ damage, including kidney failure and vision problems.

In Brown's study, all patients had high systolic blood pressure of between 150 and 180 mm Hg.

Normal blood pressure is usually below 140 mm Hg systolic.

The researchers compared patients given either aliskiren alone, amlodipine alone, or a combination of both for 16 weeks.

After the first 16 weeks, those on single drugs switched to the combination and those taking the combination continued doing so.

The researchers found that patients given initial combination therapy had an average of 6.5 mm Hg greater reduction in mean systolic blood pressure than those taking the single drugs. At 24 weeks, when all patients were on combination treatment, the difference had decreased to 1.4 mm Hg. 

Side effects such oedema or fluid retention and low blood pressure occurred at similar rates in both groups, with between 14 and 18 percent of patients stopping treatment as a result.

Scientists called for all IBD patients to be screened on admission to hospital to protect them against Clostridium difficile (C diff).

IBD, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, affects about 240,000 people in the UK.

The autoimmune conditions cause symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhoea, which can be severe enough to warrant admission to hospital.

Researchers in London looked at NHS admission records from 2002 to 2008 and found a strong link between IBD, C diff, and death in hospital.

IBD patients infected with C diff were six times more likely to die than those who escaped the bug. After 30 days, their mortality rate was as high as 25%.

The findings, reported in the journal Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, also showed that IBD patients with C diff had longer stays in hospital and were almost twice as likely to need gastrointestinal surgery.

Typically they remained in hospital for 26 days, compared with five days for patients without C diff.

Dr Sonia Saxena, one of the researchers from the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, said: ``Hospitals must do everything they can to control infections such as C difficile.

We are asking for these high-risk patients to be screened for C difficile proactively on admission to hospital so that if they are exposed, they can be diagnosed and treated more quickly.''

Co-author Dr Richard Pollok, from St George's Healthcare NHS Trust, said: ``At St George's Hospital, we have seen a 70% reduction in hospital-acquired infections after implementing a range of control measures, such as careful handwashing and reduced use of broad spectrum antibiotics.

15-11-017_bbcnews,2011-11-11,Skin transformed for cancer fight,"Scientists have opened up the possibility of one day using cancer patients' own skin to fight their tumours.

Oxford University researchers transformed skin cells into immune cells, which could be used to trigger a hunt for cancer.

It was achieved only in the laboratory, not in people, meaning any therapy is a long way off.

However, the researchers believe it will be possible.

Harnessing the power of the immune system is a field being pursued by cancer researchers, such as in the search for cancer vaccines.

The conductor 

This study, published in the journal Gene Therapy, was focused on dendritic cells, which organise part of the immune response. 

By showing identifying markers - or antigens - they tell the immune system what to attack.

If they display cancer markers, cancerous cells will become the target.

Dr Paul Fairchild, from the Oxford Stem Cell Institute, said trials into dendritic cells, harvested from a patient's blood, had taken place before, but they fired up only part of the immune system.

His team used advances in stem cell technology to create new dendritic cells from a patient's skin.

These were primed to trigger an attack on melanomas using a marker, Melan A, which is unique to the cancer.

Experiments in the laboratory showed these dendritic cells were able to activate both immune cells which produce antibodies and those which kill other cells.

Dr Fairchild said: ""The patient would in effect be treated with their own immune cells to prime an attack on their tumour.""

He acknowledges that any therapy is a distant prospect.

The cost and a safe method of producing stem cells are two of the barriers.

Even then he pictures a treatment working alongside, rather than replacing, other therapies: ""It is a long and arduous process compared with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. It's extremely labour intensive.""

Dr Caetano Reis e Sousa, a Cancer Research UK immunology expert, said: ""By showing that normal body cells can be reprogrammed to become a sub-type of dendritic cells with superior activity, this research builds on previous work by Cancer Research UK scientists using blood stem cells as starting material.

Women who have had chlamydia are at greater risk of an ectopic pregnancy because of a lasting effect of the infection, according to new research.

A study by Edinburgh University experts has shown for the first time of how the sexually-transmitted infection can increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy.

An ectopic pregnancy is when an embryo implants in the Fallopian tube.

Women who have had chlamydia are more likely to produce a protein in their Fallopian tubes, the study said.

Increased production of this protein, known as PROKR2, makes a pregnancy more likely to implant outside of the womb.

Sexually transmitted

The study follows on from research, also at Edinburgh University, which showed that production of a similar protein increased the likelihood of smokers having an ectopic pregnancy.

Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the UK. It can be treated but often goes undiagnosed because it can occur without symptoms.

The infection is known to cause infertility as it can lead to scarring and blockages in the Fallopian tube.

The research shows, however, that chlamydial infection linked to ectopic pregnancy causes ""much more subtle changes"" in the Fallopian tube, without evidence of severe scarring.

The study, published in the American Journal of Pathology, was funded by the Wellbeing of Women and the Medical Research Council.

Dr Andrew Horne, of Edinburgh University's centre for reproductive biology, said: ""We know that chlamydia is a major risk factor for ectopic pregnancy but until now we were unsure how the infection led to implantation of a pregnancy in the Fallopian tube.

A test already given to patients complaining of chest pain is used to decide if they have a damaged heart.

But in hospitals where a new, more sensitive test is being used, the number of patients diagnosed with a heart attack has increased by a third.

The University of Edinburgh study found that the new procedure halved the risk hospital readmission or dying from another heart attack within the next year.

Patients admitted to hospital with chest pain undergo a blood test to measure a protein, troponin, released when heart cells are damaged.

The new test can detect troponin at levels four times lower than the previous standard test.

Every year more than 500,000 people are taken to hospital, often by ambulance with siren blaring, suffering from acute chest pains.

But more than three out of four are discharged without a deleterious diagnosis.

Now a new blood test suggests as many as one in three of those patients did in fact have a minor heart attack.

More important, when the test was introduced at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and the extra heart attack victims were treated it halved the risk of their being readmitted to hospital - or dying from - another heart attack within a year.

The new test is more sensitive than those in standard use and detected heart muscle damage not picked up by them.

It measures a protein - troponin - released when heart muscle cells are damaged through being starved of oxygen owing to a blood clot blocking a coronary artery during a heart attack.

Researchers studying the more sensitive test found it detected troponin at levels four times lower than before, revealing patients with less serious, but still significant, heart damage.

Dr Nicholas Mills, of the British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""Unfortunately, the use of outdated diagnostic thresholds for troponin continues to be widespread and lowering this threshold remains a highly contentious issue among doctors.

The research shows it is not just patients with major heart attacks where treatment can make a difference.

Even patients with comparatively minor heart damage benefit from these treatments.""

The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, analysed data from more than 2,000 patients admitted to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh with suspected heart attacks.

Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""Over recent years it has become clear that people who suffer heart pain but only a small amount of heart damage are at a very high risk of going on to have a larger, potentially fatal, heart attack if left untreated.

This test will help doctors identify this vulnerable group of patients.

05-11-010_scotsman,2011-03-23,Test will save thousands of hidden heart attack victims,"Thousands of people at high risk of suffering a heart attack could be saved by an improved blood test, a new study by Scottish researchers suggests.

The team at the University of Edinburgh found that in patients admitted to hospital with chest pains, the use of a more sensitive blood test to identify heart muscle damage increased the number of patients diagnosed with a heart attack by a third.

They also found that after this test was introduced into clinical practice the risk of being readmitted to hospital with or dying from another heart attack within the following year was halved.

And patients were more likely to see a specialist and to receive better treatment following the introduction of the more sensitive test, according to the research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Experts are now calling for wider use of the test across the NHS to improve the care of heart attack patients.

The test - which was trialled on more than 2,000 patients at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh - can detect troponin, the protein released when heart muscle cells are damaged in an attack, at extremely low levels.

Researchers evaluating the more sensitive test detected troponin at levels four times lower than the previous standard test, allowing them to identify patients with smaller amounts of heart damage.

It was able to diagnose a third more patients as having had a heart attack than the standard test, which is still widely used.

Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director at charity the British Heart Foundation, said: ""This promising study shows us that by using a more sensitive test for heart muscle damage, more patients who come to hospital with chest pains are identified as having suffered a small heart attack.

""Over recent years it has become clear that people who suffer heart pain but only a small amount of heart damage are at a very high risk of going on to have a larger, potentially fatal heart attack if left untreated.

""This test will help doctors identify this vulnerable group of patients.""

He added that if further research corroborates the study's findings, there will be considerable pressure on the NHS to adopt the new test as standard for patients with chest pain.

Dr Nicholas Mills, of the British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""Unfortunately, the use of outdated diagnostic thresholds for troponin continues to be widespread and lowering this threshold remains a highly contentious issue among doctors.

""We provide compelling evidence that adopting a more sensitive test and lowering the threshold for detection of heart muscle damage is appropriate and will substantially improve the outcome of patients with chest pain and suspected heart attack.""

05-11-010_bbcnews,2011-03-23,Heart attack test 'detects more',"A more sensitive blood test could improve the diagnosis of heart attacks in patients who have minor damage.

Scientists from Edinburgh University said it could measure damage to heart muscles at a level four times deeper than the standard blood test.

They said this increased the number of patients diagnosed with a heart attack by a third.

Researchers said diagnosis halved the risk of patients dying of a heart attack within a year.

Data from more than 2,000 patients admitted to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary with chest pains and suspected heart attacks was analysed.

The blood test measures a protein - troponin - which is released when heart cells are damaged during a heart attack. 

Researchers said the more sensitive test detected troponin at levels four times lower than the previous standard test.

They said it could help identify heart attacks which would otherwise have gone undiagnosed and patients were more likely to see a specialist. 

Those with comparatively minor heart damage could also benefit.

Dr Nicholas Mills, of the British Heart Foundation's centre for cardiovascular science at Edinburgh University, yesterday called on the health service to introduce the technique which identifies heart muscle damage - and is four times more sensitive than current tests.

People admitted to hospital with chest pains are currently given a blood test to measure the levels of protein troponin, released when heart cells are damaged.

The new test can detect the substance at levels four times lower than the current method.

A trial at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary found its use increased the number of chest-pain patients diagnosed with a heart attack by a third.

It also halved the number of heart-attack patients being readmitted to hospital with, or dying from, another cardiac arrest within the following year.

Researchers said those tested were more likely to see a specialist and receive better treatment.

Dr Mills said adopting the more sensitive method 'will substantially improve' outcomes for patients.

He added: 'The research shows us it is not just patients with major heart attacks where treatment can make a difference.

Losing their father between the ages of seven and 16 made boys four to five per cent more likely to have a child by the age of 23 than boys who continue to live with a male parent, the research showed. 

But the departure of their father, particularly between the ages of 11 and 16, was also linked to a delay in the age at which boys began puberty. 

The study of 9,500 men born in 1958, published in the Royal Society's Biology Letters journal, showed that 25 per cent of boys living with their father saw their voice begin to break by the age of 13. 

In boys whose fathers left when they were eleven or older, this figure dropped to 19 per cent, and in those who grew up without fathers from an earlier age the figure was 23 per cent. 

Paula Sheppard, one of the paper's authors, said: ""Our research suggests that it's not just the absence of a father that can affect when a boy experiences puberty and becomes a father, but also the timing of that absence.

This potentially fatal condition, which can lead to kidney or liver damage, blood clotting and seizures, is tricky to diagnose, so anything that can help is welcomed.

Every year seven to 10 UK women and 1,000 babies die as a result of the condition, which is also responsible for a quarter of all premature births.

We already know that anyone who's suffered before from pre-eclampsia or who has chronic high blood pressure, diabetes, a kidney disorder or migraine is at increased risk.

You're also more likely to get it if you're obese, older than 40 or younger than 18, or you suffer from certain conditions including Polycystic Ovary Syndrome or rheumatoid arthritis.

Don't worry if any of this applies, you can be carefully monitored throughout your pregnancy so early warning signs like high blood pressure and protein in the urine can be spotted and controlled. 

But we also know that it affects one in 20 first pregnancies, including those in healthy women. And it's these women who are most difficult to identify.

Cue the new test. Scientists have devised a model that assesses a woman's personal risk according to certain factors.

For instance, women with coronary heart disease in the family seem to be at increased risk while women who eat plenty of fruit seem to have a reduced risk.

The findings need to be confirmed with more research but once this has been done doctors will be able to use a set formula to calculate a woman's personal risk, pinpointing exactly who should be monitored from the start before problems show. 

This will hopefully save lives.

In the meantime, if you're pregnant, try to keep your high blood pressure down by eating plenty of fruit and veg and avoiding salt and alcohol. 

Always keep antenatal appointments and be alert to the potential warning signs.

These include swelling of your feet, ankles, face and hands, severe headaches, blurred vision, stomach or shoulder pain, and nausea and vomiting later on in pregnancy.

05-11-030_independent,2011-10-30,Brain DNA 'changes through life',"New research on brain cells could shed more light on neurological diseases, scientists have discovered. 

Researchers from The Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh have found brain cells alter their genetic make-up during a person's lifetime.

They have identified genes - known as retrotransposons - responsible for thousands of tiny changes in the DNA of brain tissue.

Researchers, whose work is published in the journal Nature, found that the genes were particularly active in areas of the brain linked to cell renewal.

By mapping the locations of these genes in the human genome, scientists could identify mutations that impact on brain function and that may cause diseases to develop.

The study shows for the first time that brain cells are genetically different to other cells in the body and are also genetically distinct from each other.

Scientists are now researching whether brain tumour formation and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's are associated with a change in retrotransposon activity.

Dr Geoff Faulkner said: ""This research completely overturns the belief that the genetic make-up of brain cells remains static throughout life and provides us with new information about how the brain works.

""If we can understand better how these subtle genetic changes occur we could shed light on how brain cells regenerate, how processes like memory formation may have a genetic basis and possibly link the activity of these genes to brain diseases.""

A team at Edinburgh University found that genes known as retrotransposons were responsible for thousands of tiny changes in the DNA of brain tissue.

The findings could help scientists looking for the causes of brain diseases like dementia and brain tumours, or be used in tests to help identify those at risk of suffering problems in future.

The researchers, from The Roslin Institute at Edinburgh University, found that the retrotransposon genes were particularly active in areas of the brain linked to the renewal of cells.

By finding the locations of these genes in the human genome - a map of our entire genetic make-up - scientists could identify mutations that impact on brain function and that may cause diseases to develop.

For the first time, the study, published in the journal Nature, also showed that brain cells are genetically different to other cells in the body and are genetically distinct from each other.

""If we can understand better how these subtle genetic changes occur we could shed light on how brain cells regenerate, how processes like memory formation may have a genetic basis and possibly link the activity of these genes to brain diseases.""

Dr Faulkner said previously scientists believed that every cell in the body was the same in its genetics, whereas their findings showed that brain cells could vary genetically during life.

He said in future it may be possible to use the findings to help predict whether some people may be more prone to some diseases than others, but further work was needed.

""The issue at the moment is that we don't know if these conditions are necessary for a healthy brain, so it could be that this level of variation is necessary for functioning,"" he said.

""But you could imagine that too much mutation in a brain could lead to cancer and perhaps to neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's.

""Our study dealt with healthy brains so we can speculate on disease and think there is some involvement, but we don't have direct evidence of that at the moment.""

Dr Faulkner said now they had found that brain cells were actually changing, the next question was to look at what they were doing as they changed.

""We are really interested in looking at different types of disease and have plans to look at brain tumours and some Alzheimer's cases as well,"" he said.

15-11-006_dailymail,2011-03-21,Alzheimer's breakthrough as scientists find out how to deliver drugs directly to the brain,"The technique overcomes the blood-brain barrier that protects the brain from harmful chemicals but also stops drugs reaching target cells

Scientists have found a new way to deliver drugs directly to the brain, raising hopes of more effective treatments for Alzheimer’s disease sufferers.

A team from University of Oxford successfully switched off a gene implicated in Alzheimer’s disease in the brains of mice by exploiting tiny particles naturally released by cells, called exosomes.

The exosomes, injected into the blood, act as 'drugs vehicles' - crossing the normally impermeable blood-brain barrier to the brain where they are needed.

This barrier is a natural defence against potentially harmful chemicals floating around the body but has also stopped useful drugs reaching the brain as well.

The scientists say the research, published in the journal Nature Biotechnology, is still at an early stage - and is many years from being tested in people.

But it could also make it easier to treat Parkinson’s disease, motor neurone disease and muscular dystrophy.

Lead scientist Dr Matthew Wood said: 'These are dramatic and exciting results.

'It’s the first time new ‘biological’ medicines have been delivered effectively across the blood-brain-barrier to the brain.

'This is the first time this natural system has been exploited for drug delivery.'

Over the years, many drugs have been developed to target specific parts of the disease pathways.

But while these have shown good results in the lab, getting them to the right part of the body has often proved problematic.

The major barrier for these drugs is delivery,' said Dr Wood said. 

'This problem becomes even greater when you want to reach the brain.

The blood-brain barrier - which stops most things in the blood stream from crossing to our brains - is much too great an obstacle.

'We’ve shown that a natural system could be exploited to deliver drugs across the blood-brain barrier. 

We believe we can use this same technology for Alzheimer’s, motor neurone disease, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s.'

Safety tests would be needed before the technique could be used on people, he added.

The Alzheimer’s Society welcomed the findings but said more research was needed to see if the method would be effective.

Dr Susanne Sorensen, head of research at the charity, said: 'In this exciting study, researchers may have overcome a major barrier to the delivery of potential new drugs for many neurological diseases including Alzheimer’s.

'The blood-brain barrier protects the brain from harmful chemicals but also makes it difficult for drugs to reach the target cells. 

If this delivery method proves safe in humans, then we may see more effective drugs being made available for people with Alzheimer’s in the future.'

 In the past, efforts to treat Alzhe-imer's have been hampered by the difficulty of getting drugs past this barrier to the brain.

Scientists hope this target mechanism could be used to administer drugs for brain diseases such as Parkinson's, motor neurone disease and muscular dystrophy.

But they warned it will be some time before they can carry out tests on humans.

Lead scientist Dr Matthew Wood said: ""These are dramatic and exciting results.

""It's the first time new 'biological' medicines have been delivered effectively across the blood-brain barrier to the brain.""

Dr Susanne Sorensen, of the Alzheimer's Society, welcomed the findings but said more research was needed.

15-11-006_express,2011-03-21,Breakthrough in Britain's fight to beat Alzheimer's,"SCIENTISTS have overcome a key problem in treating common memory and brain disorders, which could herald a new generation of treatments.

A ""dramatic and exciting"" study has revealed a novel way to get medicines into the brain to treat conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, motor neurone disease and muscular dystrophy.

Until now, it has been very difficult to get drugs into the brain because of an efficient filter known as the blood-brain barrier.

One of the only ways has been to inject medicines directly into the brain.

Now a team from Oxford University has discovered how to hide medicines from this filter by attaching them to tiny molecules, released by cells, called exosomes.

Scientists can send drugs into the brain to switch off a gene linked to Alzheimer's disease.

But they believe it may be a few more years before the technique is safe enough to test on humans.

Dr Matthew Wood, from the department of physiology, anatomy and genetics, who led the work, said: ""These are dramatic and exciting results.

""It's the first time new biological medicines have been delivered effectively across the blood-brain barrier to the brain.""

Exosomes are small capsules that are produced by most cells in the body.

 They can break away from the cell and travel around the body, taking genetic material with them. They are thought to help cells to ""talk"" to each other.

Dr Wood added: ""We've shown that a natural system could be exploited to deliver drugs.

""We believe we can use this same technology for Alzheimer's, motor neurone disease, Parkinson's and Huntington's.

 ""The next steps are to test the exosomes in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease to see if it makes a difference to disease progression.""

The trial showed that when the drug was attached to exosomes and injected into the blood system of mice, it crossed the bloodbrain barrier and ended up in the brain. 

Once there, the type of drug delivered was able to switch off a gene linked to Alzheimer's.

This led to a 60 per cent drop in the brain of the problem enzyme linked to the gene.

Last night, a spokesman for the Alzheimer's Society said the discovery was ""very exciting"".

He said: ""The blood-brain barrier protects the brain from harmful chemicals but also makes it difficult for drugs to reach the target cells. 

If this delivery method proves safe in humans we may see more effective drugs being made available for people with Alzheimer's in the future.

""More research is now needed.

Dementia research is desperately underfunded.

""To make the breakthroughs we need, we must invest now.""

15-11-006_telegraph,2011-03-21,Alzheimer's hope after new drug discovery,"Scientists have found a new way to deliver Alzheimer's drugs directly to the brain, sparking hopes that more effective treatment could be made available to sufferers. 

Efforts to treat the disease have been hampered over the last 50 years by the difficulty of administering drugs to the brain to slow or halt its progression. 

But a team of University of Oxford researchers has successfully switched off a gene linked to Alzheimer's in the brains of mice by exploiting tiny particles naturally released by cells, called exosomes. 

The exosomes, injected into the blood, are able to carry a drug across the normally impermeable blood-brain barrier to the brain where it is needed. 

It is hoped that the method, if successfully tested in humans, could resolve the difficulty in administering potential new drugs for many neurological diseases including Parkinson's, motor neurone disease and muscular dystrophy. 

But the researchers cautioned that although the results were significant and promising, a number of steps must be taken before this form of drug delivery can be tested in humas. 

Lead scientist Dr Matthew Wood of Oxford's Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics said: ''These are dramatic and exciting results.

It's the first time new 'biological' medicines have been delivered effectively across the blood-brain-barrier to the brain. 

''This is the first time this natural system has been exploited for drug delivery.'' 

Over the years, many drugs have been developed to target specific parts of the disease pathways. 

But while these have shown good results in the lab, getting them to the right part of the body to see any effect in humans has often proved problematic. 

Delivering any such type of therapy to the brain would currently have to involve neurosurgery and nothing administered intravenously would be able to cross from the blood into the brain. 



''The major barrier for these drugs is delivery,'' Dr Wood said. ''This problem becomes even greater when you want to reach the brain.

The blood-brain barrier - which stops most things in the blood stream from crossing to our brains - is much too great an obstacle. 

''We've shown that a natural system could be exploited to deliver drugs across the blood-brain barrier.

We believe we can use this same technology for Alzheimer's, motor neurone disease, Parkinson's and Huntington's.'' 

But safety tests would be needed before the exosomes could be tested in humans, he said. 

The Alzheimer's Society welcomed the findings but said more research was needed to see if the method would be effective for Alzheimer's sufferers. 

Dr Susanne Sorensen, head of research at the charity, said: ''In this exciting study, researchers may have overcome a major barrier to the delivery of potential new drugs for many neurological diseases including Alzheimer's. 

''The blood-brain barrier protects the brain from harmful chemicals but also makes it difficult for drugs to reach the target cells.

If this delivery method proves safe in humans, then we may see more effective drugs being made available for people with Alzheimer's in the future.''

15-11-006_bbcnews,2011-03-20,Breakthrough in delivering drugs to the brain,"A new way of delivering drugs to the brain has been developed by scientists at the University of Oxford.

They used the body's own transporters - exosomes - to deliver drugs in an experiment on mice.

The authors say the study, in Nature Biotechnology, could be vital for treating diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Muscular Dystrophy.

The Alzheimer's Society said the study was ""exciting"" and could lead to more effective treatments.

Research barrier 

One of the medical challenges with diseases of the brain is getting any treatment to cross the blood-brain barrier.

The barrier exists to protect the brain, preventing bacteria from crossing over from the blood, while letting oxygen through.

However, this has also produced problems for medicine, as drugs can also be blocked. 

In this study the researchers used exosomes to cross that barrier.

Exosomes are like the body's own fleet of incredibly small vans, transporting materials between cells.

The team at Oxford harvested exosomes from mouse dentritic cells, part of the immune system, which naturally produce large numbers of exosomes.

They then fused the exosomes with targeting proteins from the rabies virus, which binds to acetylcholine receptors in brain cells, so the exosome would target the brain.

They filled the exosomes with a piece of genetic code, siRNA, and injected them back into the mice.

The siRNA was delivered to the brain cells and turned off a gene, BACE1, which is involved in Alzheimer's disease.

The authors reported a 60% reduction in the gene's activity.

""These are dramatic and exciting results"" said the lead researcher Dr Matthew Wood.

""This is the first time this natural system has been exploited for drug delivery.""

Customised 

The research group believes that the method could modified to treat other conditions and other parts of the body.

Dr Wood said: ""We are working on sending exosomes to muscle, but you can envisage targeting any tissue.

""It can also be made specific by changing the drug used.""

The researchers are now going to test the treatment on mice with Alzheimer's disease to see if their condition changes.

The team expect to begin trials in human patients within five years. 

Dr Susanne Sorensen, head of research at the Alzheimer's Society, said: ""In this exciting study, researchers may have overcome a major barrier to the delivery of potential new drugs for many neurological diseases including Alzheimer's. 

She said the blood-brain barrier had been an ""enormous issue as many potential drugs have not been properly tested because you couldn't get enough of them into the brain.""

She added: ""If this delivery method proves safe in humans, then we may see more effective drugs being made available for people with Alzheimer's in the future.""

Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""This is innovative research, but at such an early stage it's still a long way from becoming a treatment for patients. 

""Designing drugs that cross the blood brain barrier is a key goal of research that holds the promise of improving the effectiveness of Alzheimer's treatments in the future.""

Exosomes may have other medical applications.

Alexander Seifalian, a professor of nanotechnology and regenerative medicine at University College London, told the BBC: ""Experimental evidence indicates that exosomes can prime the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells, making them a potential tool as cancer vaccines."" 

He also said exosomes ""could well form the cornerstone of nanoscale drug delivery systems of the future.""

He added: ""The apparent versatility and established biosafety of exosomes underscores the potential of these biological membrane vesicles to be of tremendous potential in the realm of nanotechnology and regenerative medicine.""","{""Nature Biotechnology"": 1}","{""Matthew Wood"": 1, ""Wood"": 1, ""Susanne Sorensen"": 1, ""Simon Ridley"": 1, ""Alexander Seifalian"": 1}","{""the University of Oxford"": 1, ""Nature Biotechnology"": 1, ""Muscular Dystrophy"": 1, ""The Alzheimer's Society"": 1, ""Oxford"": 1, ""the Alzheimer's Society"": 1, ""Alzheimer's Research UK"": 1, ""University College London"": 1, ""BBC"": 1}","{""Matthew Wood"": 1, ""Wood"": 2}","{""the University of Oxford"": 1, ""Oxford"": 2, ""Nature Biotechnology"": 1, ""Muscular Dystrophy"": 1, ""The Alzheimer's Society"": 1, ""the Alzheimer's Society"": 1, ""Alzheimer's Research UK"": 1, ""University College London"": 1, ""BBC"": 1}"
